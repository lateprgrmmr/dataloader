James Robert (J.B.) Cline peacefully passed away on January 27, 2021.  He was a devoted husband of 67 years to Patsy Patrick Cline and a loving father to Sally Cline Lutz (Ron) and Carol Cline Ottaviano (Joe).  His legacy includes four granddaughters, Julie Kanstroom (Dan), Cece Dahlstrom, Kimberly Leopold (Sam), and Kelsey Kojetin (Tim); along with 4 great-granddaughters Harper Kanstroom, Eloise, Evie, and Emory Leopold.

J.B. was born in Carthage, Missouri on June 9, 1927, to Ralph and Nelle Cline.   His family and friends knew him as Jim Bob.  He was adventurous at an early age, buying his first Harley as a teenager, then selling it to take flying lessons.  At 17, he enlisted in the Navy and served in Japan on the USS Gainard as WWII ended. He saw Okinawa soon after the bombs hit.

After the war, J.B. studied business and graduated from the University of Missouri.  He then moved to Dallas to go into the wholesale lumber business.   First, he found the perfect business partner in Hobart Moses, founding Moses and Cline Forest Products.  Soon thereafter, J.B. found the perfect wife in Patsy Patrick, saying “she was the best investment I ever made”.   In the early 1960s, Moses and Cline was one of the first businesses to move to Addison.

J.B was from Missouri but was a true Texan at heart.  He loved to hunt, fish, and spend time at his Triple C Ranch with family and friends.  He was an avid Dallas Cowboy fan, dating back to the Cotton Bowl days.  Golf became his retirement passion, playing often at the Dallas Country Club.

J.B. had a quiet Christian faith, preferring to live it out by serving at the Stewpot, greeting guests with his friendly handshakes, and singing funny songs.  He also was an elder in the Presbyterian church, most recently attending Highland Park Presbyterian Church.  He was a man of honesty and integrity with a huge, kind heart.

J.B. once said his epitaph should read “Worked hard, loved hard, and died happy”.  Well done, good and faithful servant!  There will be a family celebration of life for J.B in the days ahead.   In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be made to The Stewpot, 1835 Young Street, Dallas, TX 75201, or the charity of your choice.

My body has gone but my spirit lives on, with in my kids and in you. 

The love that I have left behind I'm so sorry, but know that I love you all. Remember all the good times we had together and cherish them to the fullest  Because my body has gone and not my spirit because it lives on in my kids.

 I'll watch over you, I  was always true to them and showed them all the a father could give them. So give them all the love and attention that you gave me. Because my spirit lives on in them but my body is gone.

I want y'all to laugh and joke and not shed a tear as if I was still here. My body has gone but not my spirit. I know I left too soon , but look at this I'm with both of my fathers now with a smile on my face. 

I know I can't talk to you right now but if you want to talk to me please, because I might just hear you. Just believe in faith to pour out your heart. I said my body has gone but not my spirit.

She went to high school at Paxton Community High School in Paxton, Illinois and graduated in 1966.  She was married to Patrick Daugherty of Mattoon, Illinois in September of 1968 in Paxton, IL and had two sons, John Wayne and Paul David.  Dianne went to college later in life and graduated Cum Laude with her Associate Degree in Applied Science in May of 2001 from Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas.  Dianne lived the first part of her life in Illinois, living in Paxton, Villa Grove and Tuscola.

In 2002, she and her husband moved to Birmingham, AL where they lived until her husband’s retirement in 2013.  After his retirement, they moved back to Waxahachie, Texas, where she resided until 2016.

She wrote this short personal Christian testimony in 2001:  “I had a life-changing experience at a very young age.  I also had parents that had a life-changing experience early in their marriage.  I have felt the Lord’s guidance and wisdom in the decisions in my life.  I have recently experienced His guidance in going back to college, and now have my Associates Degree.  I couldn’t have reached that goal without the Lord’s wisdom and guidance through the entire process.  I know for certain that if I were to die today that I would go to Heaven.”

The following poem was written by her son, Paul: 
Lost You Twice 
We lost you the first time when your memories slipped away. 
We lost you a second time when you passed away. 
I’ll always remember the love you gave to me. 
Your light shining brightly for all the world to see. 
You nurtured me and helped me grow. 
I loved you more than you will ever know. 
I shall miss you and the smile on your face. 
I will miss your laughter and your warm embrace. 
I hope you found peace, no more suffering or pain. 
Although you left us, your memory will always remain. 
Love you, Mom!

As his family continued to grow, he welcomed everyone with open arms and love. The day Roy became “Papa” he was so proud to extend the love and teach the family values to the next generation. He was always there for anyone, especially the grandchildren to listen and advise and provide his love and support. There was always a family celebration for special occasions, birthdays and holidays. Everyone was expected to be there. His wife, children and grandchildren were his life.

Roy was very artistic, creative, curious and playful. He loved music. He had a special music room that he spent most of his time after he retired. He self-taught himself to play and build instruments. He wrote and recorded two songs. Both were patented and copyrighted. The slideshow presented today, includes both.

Anyone who knew Roy, knew he was a jokester. He loved to tease and cutup with everyone, especially the children. He was also known for his scary stories, the best one being Mean Tooth and Lie Tooth. All of us still laugh today, about that one.

Roy was a welder by trade. He owned and operated Patterson’s Welding Service until he retired.

He will be dearly missed by all the people who knew and loved him. He was preceded in death by his parents Homer Boyd and Ethel Loretta Patterson, his siblings Lou Ann Sutton and Boyd Wayne Patterson. He is survived by his wife Judy (Combs) Patterson, children Karen May Patterson of Midlothian, TX, Roy Dean Patterson and his wife Tina Caster Patterson of Southlake, TX, David Lee Patterson of Dallas, TX, one sister Gaynell Sprouse of Colleyville, TX, four grandchildren Mary Raquel Logan-Patterson, Michael Dean Patterson, Matthew Stephen Margolies and Daniel Austin Patterson.

Flowers should be sent to Merit Memorial Funeral & Cremation Care 12801 N. Stemmons Fwy, Suite 801 Farmers Branch, 75234 no later than Monday January 11, 2021.
Funeral services will be held on January 12, 2021 at Gospel Lighthouse Church 5525 W. Illinois Ave. Dallas, TX 75211 at 1:00 pm.

We have lost a young lady who made it through many challenges in her life. 

She was charmed by all in spite of not having speech, somehow she always made her pleasure known, either by squealing and smiling, or perhaps hiding one of your possessions and being entertained by you trying to find it, or simply stealing your drink to enjoy for herself. 

Her favorite place was Disneyland and she loved going on trips to California where she grew up.  

Lisa is survived by her parents, Ilkka and Dee Notko, her brother, David Notko, and sister, Tina Lathrom (Alan Lathrom) and nephews Jonathan and Andrew Lathrom.  

She will be missed by her family and friends, as there were so many who loved her and were happy to be part of her life.

32,33,Karin Crosby,"Karin Denise Crosby arrived on December 4, 1963 and went home on December 24, 2020. 

She was the only child of Shirley Lou Cauble Crosby and the one she always called “her favorite Marine,” her father, John Bruce Crosby.  Karin was born and raised in DFW and lived in many different communities in North Texas from as far west as Fort Worth to as far east as Garland. She was a member of the graduating class of 1982, star alto with the Duncanville High School Choir.

She studied Radio/TV at Univ. of Texas, Arlington and she was fortunate to be the exception to the rule. Karin was able to work her entire work life in an industry that was her passion.  She was able to do everything she wanted and had some great experiences and met a lot of lifelong friends along the way. 

Just a partial list of some of the places she worked…. KAFM/KAAM, KLTY, Radio Disney, The Eagle, Y100, KZPS, KSCS, MIX, KISS, Y95, and finally, iHeart Radio.
She was also a friend to members of the band, The Outfield and stayed in touch with them throughout their career. When they toured the states in '98-'99, Karin worked to book shows and promotions for the band, booking radio & TV interviews. She even got to tour with them. She loved that more than anything.  Oh, the stories she had.  She was devastated in July 2014 when her buddy and guitarist of the band, John Spinks passed away with liver cancer.  And when lead singer Tony Lewis died in October 2020, she couldn't believe it. 

Karin didn't have a lot but if she had it and you needed it, it was yours. She loved treating friends to concerts.  She loved live concerts and saw more than you could count.  Some of her favorite shows…. Cher, Aerosmith (so many times), Janet Jackson, Kelly Clarkson, so many 80's groups. She also loved Billy Crystal and Robin Williams.  And Karin was a NASCAR fan and thought Dale Jr. was the best!  When it was time to put her feet up, she would often head to the Florida panhandle beaches, Ft. Walton, Destin, Navarre and Pensacola. 
 
She loved her Mountain Dew and all her record albums. Karin had quite the collection.  Ask her friends who would help her move!   She was so strong willed which worked against her at times and sometimes, it’s what got her through the difficult times.  Karin's sense of humor could cut you to the quick and more times than not having you laughing so hard you couldn't catch your breath.  Even in hospice, she was joking with one of the nurses about her singing skills, nicknaming her “Beyoncé” and making everyone in the room laugh.   Karin was always there for her friends with an encouraging word, or if you needed an emergency babysitter or just someone you could always count on for a big smile on a not so sunny day.
Karin said she was not scared about going home and couldn't wait to see her folks again.  And wondered what Christmas would look like in heaven?  She was hoping to be greeted by her parents who she missed so much and was hoping for lots of free time to catch up on hugs and stories. Karin said she was also convinced heaven would have the best ever homemade cookies, fresh out of the oven anytime you wanted one.

Karin was so thankful for the sweet messages of support, and texts, videos, flowers that everyone sent.  It was becoming increasingly difficult for her to manage the keyboard on her cell phone, but she did see all of it and it made her smile.  Thanks to all of her friends from nearly EVERY station in town for taking a moment to pray with her and share a virtual hug or two.  She was keenly aware that we are just spirits having a human experience and looked forward to the day when she would be living in a body that no longer betrayed her.   

Karin is survived by her aunt, Norma Farris who did her best to fill in those “Mom shoes” when possible and who’s support was much appreciate by Karin especially during these last difficult months. She also had many cousins who were there for her.  Karin said she wanted to be cremated and wanted her ashes to be divided and placed in 3 locations, with her Mom in Aquilla, Texas, with her Dad in Norwalk, Connecticut, and spread at Navarre Beach in Florida, which she said was one of her favorite spots on the planet.  Norma and the family will honor Karin’s wishes soon.

Godspeed, Karin.  Here’s to God granting your final wish.

39,40,Kevin Horn,"Exactly one week before Christmas, on December 18, 2020, Kevin Horn, devoted husband, father, son, and brother, died after a lengthy illness. He was objectively one of the kindest people to walk this earth, and his passing has devastated many.

Kevin was born on October 10, 1973 in Wurtsmith AFB hospital, near Oscoda, Michigan, to David and Barbara (Marshall) Horn, and spent most of his childhood in Beaumont, Texas. He was active in both the church (Disciples of Christ) and service community (Key Club, CKI, and later Kiwanis) and was always there to lend a helping hand. He enjoyed playing soccer and played the piano and trombone quite well. He was also a member of his church’s handbell choir and high school German Club.

In 1990, Kevin was accepted into the AFS exchange student program, and lived in Germany for 10 months. He was fortunate to travel through most of Europe — the experience shaped him forever. One of his only regrets was that he could not return with his family and introduce them to his beloved Germany.

Kevin was a proud member of the Fighting Texas Aggie Class of 1996, graduating with a B.S. Degree in BANA (Business Analysis). He was a member of the business honors fraternity Delta Sigma Pi, and an integral member of Circle K International Service Organization (CKI). His favorite activities in college included: racquetball, inter-mural sports, dancing, and attending Aggie Football games (naturally). 

On June 1, 1996, he married the love of his life, Christina Marie Smock, whom he met at A&M, through CKI. Upon both their graduations, they moved to the Dallas area and eventually settled in Carrollton, TX, where they have lived for the last 20 years. They were blessed with two sons (Cameron, 18, and Fletcher, 16) and a daughter (Betsy, 11). 

Kevin started his career in 1997 at AT&T, and continued working in the IT industry as a software engineer until his death. He was most recently employed at Infosys, and contracted to Conduent; he was a valued and respected member of his team, and is sorely missed.

Kevin was known for his punny wit, his infectious smile, and his kind and compassionate spirit. He was passionate about Aggie Football, board games and dominoes (especially 42), and spending time with his family. Volunteering in the community, especially with Habitat for Humanity, and serving as deacon in his church, was also important to him. Before he became ill, he coached his younger son’s robotics team, which he loved. He had a servant’s heart until the very end.

However, Kevin’s favorite pastime of all was dancing. He and Christy actually fell in love while taking country-western dance lessons at A&M. Later, he went on to take hip-hop classes and actually performed in dance recitals, alongside his daughter. He was known as Dance Dad and very popular at the studio. Some of his best memories were shaking it on the dance floor, and escorting Betsy every year to the Daddy-Daughter Dance, where he won at least two awards (one for 1st Place!) for his moves.

Kevin is survived by his wife Christy, and their three children: Cameron, Fletcher, Betsy, by his grandmother, Geraldine, his father, David, and his mother, Barbara, his brother David Jr. and sister-in-law Sandy, mother-in-law Nancy Glover, brother-and-sister-in-law Matthew and Eugenia Smock, along with numerous uncles, aunts, and cousins.

An online memorial service will be held on Wednesday, December 30, at 1 o’clock p.m., with a virtual celebration following. We will share stories and experiences, sing songs, and maybe raise a glass or two to our beloved Kevin.

If desired, donations may be sent to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

Our world is darker now, but we know that Kevin is dancing in heaven and looking after us all, especially this holiday season."

42,43,Diane Marie Larsen,"Diane Marie Larsen passed away peacefully at home surrounded by family and friends on December 14, 2020. She was born, at home, in Dallas on February 13, 1958. She was the 6th of 7 children of Jay and Kay Larsen.

She cherished her childhood memories of Woodwind Lane. She attended Saint Monica and graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in 1976, beginning many friendships that lasted her entire life.  Eager to begin her life adventure, working for Western  Merchandise, she transferred to Santa Fe, NM.  Her job with Playboy (Book Division, Really!!)  transferred her to Houston to begin her 40-year love affair with the city.   Additionally, she was an apartment manager for Farb Development.  Eventually, she found her calling as a massage therapist at Sweetwater Country Club where she worked for over 30 years, and she was a great one! 

Diane’s real passion in life was family, friends and the people she met along her journey. She had a “larger than life” personality and never met a stranger. She was a master storyteller. Great listener. Humorous. Loving. Head strong, at times. Compassionate. Loyal. Hard working. Friend of Bill W.’s for 36 years and always ready to help anyone in need of Bill W. She was a great mother to all her 4-legged dogs and cats over the years. Though never a mother herself, she had a magical bond with her nieces and nephews. She relished and shined in that role. It was one of her greatest joys.

She is preceded in death by her parents, Jay and Kay Larsen and sister, Judy Larsen. She is survived by her partner of 28 years, Sharon Neider. Sisters Karla and Debra Larsen, Jill Lozier, and brothers Kent (Kathy) and Brett Larsen.  Nieces Kelly Lozier and Elizabeth Wright and nephews Hunter and Harrison Wright, Daniel Lozier, Levi Strauss, Dustin Neider, and Hunter Larsen, Phillip and Mark Larsen.

Diane was Viking Strong and faced her battle with faith, love, grace, determination, courage, and humor. She courageously participated in a clinical trial for pancreatic cancer at Baylor College of Medicine with the help of many fantastic medical professionals. What was learned from the trial is helping people who are still fighting today. Thank you to all who supported Diane on her journey home.

47,48,Deborah Ann Bennett,"Deborah Ann Bennett, age 72, of Dallas, TX, passed away on December 11, 2020.  

Debbie was born in San Antonio, TX, to Wayne and Ruth Bennett on June 27, 1948.  She grew up in University Park, graduating from Highland Park High School.  She went on to earn a bachelor’s degree from SMU in 1969, and studied French at Alliance Française in Paris, France.   

Debbie loved adventure, and, with her good friend Pam Lenau, spent a year after college traveling around the world.  Debbie’s other passion was sailing.  She logged more than 40,000 miles over a 15-year period, including two transatlantic passages, sailing throughout the Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda and the East Coast of the US.  Her sailing experiences and talent for writing and research led to positions as associate editor, contributing editor and freelance writer for several sailing magazines, including Cruising World and Practical Sailor.  

Debbie took child-like delight in all things colorful.  She bought clothes and jewelry with the eye of an art collector.  Whimsical, colorful animal objects were favorites.  On her travels or at the neighborhood antique mall, she never tired of looking at beautiful things.  

She is preceded in death by her parents, brother Derek A. Bennett and nephew Gavin D. Bennett.  Survivors include sister-in-law Kay Bennett of Prosper, TX, and nephew Brooks Bennett (Aly) and family of Chesterfield, Missouri, as well as friends in Dallas, the Newport RI area, New York City and Mexico.

51,52,Richard Mureen,"Richard (Dick) Wayne Mureen was born on November 25, 1940 in Galesburg, Illinois to Robert W. Mureen and Marguerite (Peggy) Barnes.  He died following a short illness on December 5, 2020 in Denton, Texas.  The family is grateful for Julia Sandoval who took Dick into her family home for eleven years.

Dick appreciated all the simple thing in life and always wanted to know how you were doing. He was a gentle soul who loved all sports, but especially Baseball, Basketball and Ice Hockey.  Going to any sporting event was a special treat he would look forward to and never forget.  He also had a great love for music, family, and friends, especially singing hymns and Christmas Carols with family.  The memory of Dick that his family will likely keep forever is his unfailing kindness, unconditional love, and good humor.  Developmentally challenged from birth, he never complained or spoke a negative word.  In fact, his inspiring positive attitude sometimes made it hard for his caregivers to know he was in pain or having difficulty.  One family member liked to say, “if everyone in the world had Dick’s attitude, we would have no problems”.  

Dick is survived by his sister, Judith Daugherty Gibson (Dave), brother Christopher Joel Mureen (Abby), many nieces, nephews, and cousins and was preceded in death by his parents and sister, Sigrid Lynn Mureen.

54,55,Ralph Rollans,"John Ralph Rollans Jr. was born on March 12, 1939 to John Ralph and Olga Rollans in Vernon, Tx. He died on December 3, 2020 in Plano, Tx from declining health and Covid complications. He had many health issues over the past few years but always had a great attitude. He was a tough fighter who never complained. 

He attended Guthrie Elementary, Locket High School, and Vernon High School. He graduated  From VHS in 1957. He enjoyed playing football and basketball during his high school years. He was beloved by his classmates. 

He attended Abilene Christian College where he received a bachelor’s degree in math. He then attended Texas Tech University and received his master’s degree. While going to Texas Tech he taught math at a nearby junior college to support his family. He helped many college friends “get through” the difficult math courses. He loved teaching math!

He married the love of his life Nora Elaine Overand on August 27, 1960. The love they shared was deep and profound. They first met when they were 8 and 9 years old as neighbors on the Bateman Ranch near Guthrie, Texas. Many years later, at the encouragement of his mother Olga their paths crossed, and they were married in Rochester, Texas. They moved to Abilene where he attended ACC. They had one son Ralph Gregory in Abilene and then moved to Lubbock where they had their second son John Bradley. 

After receiving his master’s degree, he went to work for Texas Instruments and moved to Irving, Texas. There he worked in the Geophysical Division of Texas Instruments. He made many lifelong friends while at TI.

In later years Haliburton bought the GSI division and Ralph was transferred to Bedford, England. He and Elaine lived in Bedford for several years and enjoyed travelling the countryside while they were there.

Ralph and Elaine came back to the states and Ralph commuted to Houston, Texas for a while. He then worked for Citizens and traveled to Rochester, New York where he made many new friends. He never met a stranger. 

His early retirement years were spending time with Elaine, keeping in touch with friends and doing volunteer work at Richardson East. He worked in the Care Corp at the church picking up and distributing groceries for the church pantry donated by local businesses. He and Elaine were part of a Richardson East life group that met in Plano on a regular basis. After 53 years of marriage Elaine went to be with the Lord.  Ralph exhibited such a strong Faith in Christ and studied his bible often. He had such a servant and humble Heart.

Whenever a helping hand was needed Ralph volunteered. He helped Alan Bryan, a senior member from church dress for church and took him and his wife to church and back home. Shortly after Alan died, Charlie Broom needed help too.  What a blessing he was to them and their families.

Ralph also responded to the need of a high school classmate from Dallas with Parkinson’s. The friend wanted to attend their Vernon High class reunion, but his wife needed help because he was in a wheelchair. Ralph was instrumental in helping him get to the Reunion and encouraged other classmates to visit with him at their hotel. On other occasions, in Dallas he brought him brats from Henk’s Deli. Anyone who knew Ralph understood Henke’s Black Forrest Café’ was his favorite spot to meet with friends for lunch.

Ralph also loved to make origami shirts from dollar bills and would give them to children at church or as a tip to a hard-working waitress at a restaurant. He would sit behind a child in church and before the service was over, he had constructed a perfect dollar bill shirt and presented it to them. Such a sweet thing for him to do.

Ralph loved to fish and hunt whether it was on his parent’s farm, on someone else’s land, East Texas or even in Florida. He learned to hunt at an early age on his parent’s land south of Vernon. He also enjoyed working on cars and passed this interest on to his sons.

Ralph is preceded in death by his wife Elaine in 2013 and a brother Mickey Rollans who died in early 2020. Ralph is survived by his two sons, Greg and Brad, Brad’s wife Michele and their daughter Merideth. He is also survived by his sister Evasue Rollans Firmin, her husband Mike and their daughter Jennifer. He is survived by Mickey’s wife Dianne Pettit Rollans, their two sons, Ryan, Mike, and wife Valerie.

Ralph leaves behind many friends from all walks of his life. His big heart, generosity and compassion drew people to him. The love he shared for his friends was apparent. And they loved him as well. He kept in touch with almost all of them and would have lunch or a visit with them whenever he could, which brought him much joy. 

He had planned a future trip to the hill country with his good friend Doug Harris upon Ralph’s release from his latest medical rehab. He had several friends he wanted to visit on his bucket list. He always wanted to make it back to Scotland to visit David Stott and visit his friend Larry Shaver in Oregon, but he was not physically able to make these trips.

Ralph was a true friend to many. He loved his family and would do anything for them. He was a special servant, friend, father, brother, dad, granddad, father-in-law, brother-in-law and uncle and he loved the Lord. He will be deeply missed by his family and so many dear friends.

There will be a memorial service at Richardson East Church of Christ, (Care Church) on Saturday, March 13, 2021 at 2:00 pm. It will be live streamed as well as recorded for those that cannot attend.

72,73,Madelyn E. Knott,"Madelyn Emily Cross was born on April 23, 1927 in Teague, TX to Sarah Jewel and Thomas Jethro Cross. During the Great Depression, the small family moved to her Granddaddy Cross’s farm in Rosston, AR. There, the family grew until Madelyn was the oldest of ten children. Her surviving siblings and their spouses are: Bill and Margaret Cross in Bryant, AR; Sybil Cross Ray (her husband John now deceased) in Minden, LA; Jerry Cross of Camden, AR; and Liz and Richard Skyles in Bossier City, LA. 

Madelyn graduated from Willisville High School near Rosston, AR in 1944. She was 17 when she moved to Little Rock to live with her uncle and his wife, and work at the defense plant in Jacksonville, outside the city. Against her daddy’s wishes, she started nursing school before the end of WWII in 1945. She joined as a member of the Cadet Corps which allowed her to attend the three-year program at St. Vincent’s Hospital in Little Rock for free. Besides being paid $21 a month, she also earned one week off per year.

Madelyn graduated from St. Vincent’s program in 1948 when she met her husband, Richard “Dick” Orr Knott, who died in July 2019. They fell in love and were married on May 28, 1950. Dick was recalled by the Navy two years later to return to duty as a sailor in the Korean War. Afterwards, he went to seminary and became a Presbyterian minister and Madelyn became a minister’s wife, a role with similar duties to that of a First Lady. Although she continued working part time as an RN, Madelyn’s full time job was as the preacher’s wife and mother of four. She is survived by her four children: Richard Knott and his wife, Ginia; Mendy Knott and her partner Leigh; Cindy Knott; and LeAnne (Knott) Wyatt and her husband Greg.

Madelyn to her siblings, “little love” to her husband, Mom to her kids, she was called Peachie by five granddaughters and nine great grandchildren. Madelyn was famous among all her family for her cooking, a trait she passed down the family line, along with a cookbook which she co-edited called “Across the ArkLaTex—A Cross Family Cookbook.” She was the ultimate Southern hostess, her style and charm on display at church gatherings, holiday parties, and open houses at the Presbyterian manse. She had many creative gifts which included sewing, gardening, and shopping for sales. Her children inherited many of her finest traits including an enduring respect for education and learning outside the classroom, reading, creativity, and a curiosity which made her a great listener and conversationalist. Madelyn believed “love is a verb” and taught us to be generous and to give of what we have to those less fortunate than us.

Madelyn stowed her “Christmas cash” a little at a time, hiding it in sock drawers and shoeboxes until it was time to shop. Her last act in this world was to choose personalized ornaments for each of her nine great grandchildren, even though she knew she would not live to see the pictures of their smiling faces this holiday. But a gifted imagination allowed her to see them all the same, glittering along the limbs of their family trees, turning in the sparkling lights she loved.

Madelyn Knott, a woman strong in her faith, long on love, and loyal to her husband of 69 years, died on Nov. 8, 2020 at the age of 93, surrounded by her four children. Although she may have thought she left a small footprint on this earth, we know that nobody will ever be able to fill her shoes.

Mom, we will miss you every day. Love, your kids.

Services for Madelyn Knott will be held at Mt. Moriah Church in Arkansas. The date will be announced as soon as all family members are able to attend. In lieu of flowers we ask that donations be made in her name to St. Jude’s Hospital: http://giftfunds.stjude.org/MadelynKnott

Jane had a successful career working in the food brokerage industry with several national companies that eventually led her Dallas, TX, in 1987. Jane had a great love and passion for traveling worldwide with her husband John, as well as with her friends, and family. Jane was known to many as the ""hostess with the  mostest"".

Jane is remembered for the thoughtful and extraordinary lengths she would go to in creating lasting and treasured moments for those she loved and appreciated.

78,79,Nell Naomi Hudson Schmitt,"It is with the deepest sadness that we announce the passing of our super cute beloved Mother, Nell Naomi Hudson Schmitt. She was 98 yrs.  “Mom died suddenly on Sunday afternoon of natural causes at her home in Dallas, Texas.. We rejoice in the extraordinary life she lived and we feel grateful and blessed to have been loved by such a terrific Mom. Thank you for all of your prayers. We are steadfast in our faith and finding comfort in knowing where Mom is, Phil 4:13.

Nell Naomi Peters was born in 1922 in Clinton Tennessee (Anderson County) at home to her parents Ruby Peters and John Henry Peters. She attended Old Knoxville High School in Knoxville, Tennessee. Nell had a love for the country as her Father was a farmer and upon his passing she requested to go live with her Uncle Luther and Aunt Alta who also lived in the country with livestock and Mom was happy. Her younger sister, Ann lived with her mom but the sisters could visit alot.
 
Nell married Al Hudson at a young age at McKendree Methodist Church, Nashville, Tennessee and they lived on Green Hills Drive and enjoyed having 3 boys Gary, Hardy and Randy there before moving to Biltmore Dr where Debbie was born. That completed the family of 6 with 4 children.

Nell and Al both loved fishing and golf and all the kids were taught golf lessons at a very young age. They took the kids to the banks of Center Hill Lake while Debbie was still in her playpen. Nell was serious about her fishing and cooking on the campfire morning noon and night. Now about this family of future golfers-- Boy, with this family of serious competitors-- if you didn't talk golf at the dinner table, you didn't talk. All the family members golfed at Richland Country Club. Mr Al was playing poker in the men's tap room til the wait staff couldn't lie any longer. Dinner time was over!

The boys all became very good golfers and several times played each other for the club championship- Poor Daddy, who to pull for? Now Mama Nell was a good golfer and won several of the ladies events herself. This family was an athletic competitive family. Hey even Debbie won the Women's Jr. Golf Club Championship.

But Gary was the football stud. He got a football scholarship to Vanderbilt and at every game you could hear Daddy above all others… yelling…….Go Littleman! Gary was so glad to be at Vanderbilt with his studies but also being in Nashville close to home so he could bring all the football buddies home to eat. Two turkeys and he would say… Mom do we have any more food? Ha! Then he was off to become a 2nd lieutenant becoming a pilot and flew all over the world many times.  Then he went off to work for Minnie Pearl Fried Chicken in California, then other adventures shuffled him around the country with new franchise opportunities and then to settle in Dallas.  He first got into Commercial Real Estate, then he fancied the oil business and was mentored by some of Dallas’s top oil men- the Oil business has been good to him...after all these years.

Now Hardy had landed in Orlando after college working for Mattel toys but he disliked it because it was too easy and as he tells it, “Barbie sells herself”, so he started finding items at garage sales and estate sales and collected so many opening a small store and now after 50 years, he's still in the antique business in Winter Park, Fla becoming a Sotheby's expert on Majolica and many other collectibles.

Now there's Randy who sold golf clubs to the Japanese after college and becoming one of the well known golfers in Nashville and also trying out for the mini golf tour. He continued to golf and became well known for his golfing prowess up until this very day. Ask him about anything dealing with golf and he will give you a knowledgeable opinion on it.
 
Debbi married and had one son, Justin Callahan after moving to Dallas, that became their home. Debbi attended interior design school in Dallas and she started her interior design business that is still running strong.

After Al's passing at age 68, Mom ran their display company until there was an explosion from a large drum of paint thinner and everything blew up- so Gary living in Dallas brought Mom into the Oil business asking her “what would you like to do in the oil business?” She declared” I wanna be a land man ! “ So she started leasing land for oil exploration in a small town in Tennessee called Wartburg, Did I say it was a small town? Only one diner in the town...oh it was her favorite time ever. She told me she felt free and she loved her new life. Well the oil business hit a bad economy after 6 years and she came back to Dallas...knowing she loved traveling , she became a travel agent. She began to travel and loved that freedom too- so after being widowed for 15 yrs she met her husband on a dating travel service, no not online...it was still snail mail.  She married Ardell and moved to California - marrying in Nashville in 1992. they traveled all over the world Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Hawaii, Turkey, Greece, South America, All over Mexico, Switzerland, England, France, Capri, South of France, Monte Carlo, Bermuda, Spain, Portugal, Alaska, Belfast, Istanbul, many times over...until he fell unable to travel so much.

So back in Dallas they came and moved into an assisted living community and lived there for 7 years until Ardell passed from natural causes of dementia.  Mom lived on for 6 more years as Dallas was where her oldest son Gary and Debbie lived. So we got to be with Mom alot in her last years, doing brunches, musical events, horse races, champagne dinners, church, anything there might be FUN. So to say Mom lived a wonderful life being filled with family, grit, strength and enthusiasm to her last day October 25, 2020 when she went to be with her heavenly Father. WE know she is dancing and singing with the Jesus that she loves as he loves her.

Nell survived her two husbands, both parents, and her sister Ann Hackney, Survivors are 3 sons…Gary R Hudson, Hardy M Hudson, Randy A Hudson and daughter Debbi A Hudson, grandchildren, Justin Kyle Callahan and wife Sara Beth Callahan, Sarah Alexandra Hudson, niece Charlotte Jellicorse and her husband, Tom Jellicorse.

The family wants to extend our heartfelt gratitude to all of our friends, relatives and contemporaries in celebrating Nell Naomi Hudson Schmitts life.
Love to all !

80,81,Leah Muenzler Campbell,"Leah Muenzler Campbell, 51, of Dallas, Texas; beloved mother, daughter, sister, aunt, and friend passed from this earth peacefully on October 24, 2020, after a courageous battle with Colon Cancer.  With her strong faith and love of the beach; specifically, South Padre Island where she spent summers both as a child and later with her family, there is little doubt where Leah will spend time - enjoying those sunny shores.    

Leah was born in 1969, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  She grew up in Edmond, Oklahoma and graduated from Edmond Memorial High School in 1988.  Leah then attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas where she received a bachelor’s degree in Sociology in 1992.  She later attended Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, TX, receiving a master’s degree in Social Work.  Leah also took and passed the licensure exam to become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW).  

With Leah’s natural caring nature, it’s not surprising that every job in her career was focused on helping people.  She started out as a Caseworker with Children’s Protective Services in Houston, Texas.  She later moved to Dallas and worked for Hope Cottage Pregnancy and Adoption Center where she performed both pre- and post-adoption services.  Most recently, Leah worked both for AssuraSource, providing behavioral health counseling services to home-bound adults, and as an independent counselor to children in foster care.  Leah was beloved by all of her clients and will be missed greatly.  

The job Leah loved most, however, was being a mother.  Leah is survived by the loves of her life, her sons Cayden and Gavin Campbell.  She is also survived by her mother, Georgia Muenzler of Tulsa, Oklahoma, sisters Julie Muenzler of Dallas, Texas; Paige Simpsen of Richardson, Texas; Father of her sons and great friend Paul Campbell of Dallas, Texas; Niece Holly Simpsen, Nephew John Simpsen, and many, many other friends and family members.  She was preceded in death by her father William Stanley Muenzler.

An outdoor Celebration of Life service and reception will be held on Thursday, November 5th at 3:00pm.  Due to COVID restrictions an exact count of attendees will be required prior to the event.  If you are interested in attending, please send an email to tamar_schacknow@yahoo.com by 5:00pm on Friday, October 30th.

A confirmation email will be sent to you with the specifics including location and details of the service.     
 
In lieu of flowers, Leah requests donations be made to the MD Anderson Cancer Center.  Over the course of her Cancer journey, she learned a lot and she truly believed that the only way to eradicate this horrible disease is greater funding for research.

81,82,Betty Jane Whiting,"Betty Jane Blassingame, Whiting, a loving wife, mother, grandmother, sister and friend, went on to her heavenly home on October 21, 2020 after a courageous battle with cancer.  The devotion and unconditional love Betty had for her family and friends, as well as her unwavering trust and faith in God, supported her in this struggle and was her genuine source of strength and peace.  

Betty was born to the late Dr. Doak and Helen Blassingame in Denison, TX on July 9, 1944.  She often shared fond memories of growing up in the quant town of Denison with her four siblings, as well as attending Denison High School (Class of ’62), where she was on the Cheer Squad and Student Council, and where she was proudly elected “Speech Sweetheart” by her peers.

A significant event occurred one football Friday night in 1961 that would forever change the course of Betty’s life.  The Denison Yellow Jackets were anxiously preparing to face their biggest school rival, the Highland Park Scots. Betty Blassingame, a Senior member of the Denison High School cheerleading squad, presented the Captain of the football team, #64 John Whiting, with a challenge he couldn’t resist.  Betty promised John that if Denison could pull off a win that night (which they had never done before), she would run directly onto the field to present him with a kiss.  As fate (or sheer determination) would have it, Denison High School won the football game, John won the kiss, and this moment marked the start of Betty and John’s 58 year strong love story. 

After high school, Betty and John attended the University of North Texas where Betty found lifelong friends as a member of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority, and where she graduated with a Bachelor of Education in 1966 to prepare for her ten year career in teaching elementary school.  Betty and John were married on August 21, 1966, starting the next chapter of their lives together.  John was in the United States Air Force, which led them first to Panama City, Florida, then outside of their comfort zone, all the way to Germany.  Betty often shared wonderful memories of their time spent in Germany, the highlights being their extensive international travel (Austria, France, Romania, Switzerland, Belgium, England and Scotland),  being selected as the “Sembach Fasching Ball Princess” and predominantly featured in the newspaper, and most importantly, giving birth to their first daughter, Nancy Lynn. 
 
Betty, John and Nancy returned to the States in 1971 and settled on the North Dallas area, where their second daughter, Allison Jane, was born.  Betty stayed joyful and active during this time of her life by teaching, mothering two daughters, dating her high school sweetheart and engaging in social activities with dear friends, such as her beloved bridge group. Betty became an active member of the Richardson Symphony Orchestra Guild, where she took on many important leadership and fundraising roles within the organization.  She also started attending bi-weekly aerobics classes, which she faithfully continued for over the next thirty years.  During this stage of life, Betty and John became regular “extras” on the popular television drama, “Dallas”.  Stacks of VHS tapes hold hours of footage where Betty could be seen in the “not so distant” background pretending to dine at a restaurant or strolling glamorously in a crowd around Southfork Ranch.  It was also during this time that Betty and John found their church home at the First United Methodist Church of Richardson, where Betty’s acts of service included volunteering with the moving committee when the church expanded, and more recently, serving with the welcoming committee, greeting church parishioners with warm hugs and genuine smiles as they entered the sanctuary. 

During the “empty nester” years, Betty and John enjoyed traveling, and although the list is extensive, her most memorable trips included a River Cruise to Normandy, a Mediterranean Cruise to Israel and surrounding areas, and a guided bus tour to the USA National Parks.  It was during this time that Betty joined the Northwood Woman’s Club, engaging in their many philanthropic endeavors, fundraising needs and social events.  Through NWC and the friendships made, Betty became involved in an Antique Group, a Travel Group, a Quilting Group, a Mahjong Group, and most recently, the Chapter II Book Club.  Betty also joined a Bible Study Group where she found special fellowship with other Christian sisters through studying and learning the Word of God.

Betty wholeheartedly cherished her family, and she went above and beyond to make family time special for everyone.  Family and loved ones looked forward to the annual Fourth of July pool party where laughter was guaranteed and “Betty’s baked beans” were a favorite on the menu.  Every Christmas, Betty spent countless hours beautifully decorating every square inch of the home, wrapping elaborate packages that would rival the most exclusive window display and working for days to create the perfect meal to serve for Christmas Eve dinner.  One of her most treasured activities was following her grandkids’ athletic pursuits, and each of them knew that “Grandmommy” was their biggest fan. Betty also relished her 4:00pm weekday activity of settling into her favorite recliner and watching the latest drama unfold in Judge Judy’s courtroom.

Whether it be an acquaintance or a lifelong friend or family member, Betty was known by all for her unmatched sense of humor, for her infectious laugh, for her ability to light up a room with her beautiful smile, for her elegant fashion sense and for her unconditional kindness. Although the loss of her physical presence will be a continuous journey of healing and grieving, there is genuine comfort and hope knowing that she now rests in the arms of our creator.  Betty is more alive with Christ than she has ever been, and her treasured legacy will forever live in our hearts. 

Betty is preceded in death by her parents, Dr. Weldon Doak and Helen Shryock Blassingame; and her brother, Jan Blassingame.  She is survived by her husband of 54 years, John Hunt Whiting, and their beloved dog, Ty; her daughter, Nancy Lynn Scheer (husband Troy) of Flower Mound, TX; her daughter, Allison Jane Arne (husband Michael) of Frisco, TX; four grandchildren, Lairen Scheer, Gunner Scheer, Payton Gissler and Patrick Arne; her brother, Ames Blassingame (wife Lori); her brother, Dean Blassingame (wife Jan); and her sister, Lynne Brooks (husband Ron).  In addition to family, Betty was blessed by countless longtime friends that loved her dearly and whose friendships she cherished immensely.  
Betty’s life and legacy will be celebrated on Tuesday, December 1, 2020 at 2:00pm, and her family welcomes all to join virtually via FUMCR.com/live.

In lieu of customary remembrances, memorial contributions in Betty’s name may be directed to the First United Methodist Church Richardson, 503 N. Central Expressway, Richardson, Texas 75080.

She had fought the good fight with renal cell carcinoma for over a year and she won the Victory when the Lord took her home. 
 
Angie graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in film.  After graduation, she moved to Hollywood with friends and worked in the film industry.  When she returned to Dallas, 7 years later, she worked at an engineering firm. Angie completed her career at OMG (Order My Gear) in Dallas -- “her favorite job in the whole wide world.”  Angie loved to travel and visited many countries such as England, Guam, Australia, Tasmania, Alaska, Chile, Mexico, Patagonia, Ushuia, and Romaia as well as many U.S. cities.

Her selflessness, brightness, and kindness were apparent in everything she did. She was an inspiration to many and touched many lives in ways we may never know.  She left us with grace and a smile.

94,95,Linda S. Berta,"Linda S. Berta, 66, of Farmington Hills, MI and Dallas, TX, confidently walked through the glorious gates of heaven on September 29, 2020.  
 
Our beloved Linda lived life to the fullest - she had a lifelong, personal relationship with Jesus and loved the Lord with all of her heart.  Linda’s Christ-centered life was an inspiration to others and one of her favorite scriptures was Hebrews 13:8: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.”
 
Her greatest joy in life was being a devoted wife and loving mother, and doting on her two grandsons as “Gigi.” Earlier this year, she celebrated 40 wonderful years of marriage to her husband, Stephen.  Stephen and Linda were inseparable and loved sharing the adventure of life together.  Linda also shared an exceptionally close relationship with her daughter, Michelle and they loved long lunches and walks in the park to talk about anything and everything.  
 
Linda will be remembered as a true beauty; her joyful smile and sparkling, deep blue eyes were one of a kind. She also loved entertaining, French wine and traveling with her family, most notably to Paris, the Loire Valley, the Hawaiian Islands and California. While her family was always her number one priority, Linda also excelled in her career at the Ford Motor Company as a fourth-generation employee.
 
Linda is survived by her husband Stephen Berta, her daughter Michelle Matthews (Louis Matthews), and her two grandsons James Matthews and Henry Matthews.  While she will be greatly missed by her family and friends, we rejoice in knowing that she is with Jesus and we will see her again soon.  
 
A private viewing and funeral service will be held on Sunday, October 11th at Highland Park Presbyterian Church.

102,103,Philippe Semprez,"Philippe Henry Semprez was born on March 19th,1950 in Meung-sur-Loire (France), at home in his grandparents’ mill under which flowed the river Mauves. 

In his lifetime, the current would take him across oceans (and dimensions, by his own account).  His adventurous spirit made him an avid traveler, but he would call the American Southwest home for the better part of the last decades. 

Philippe, also known as Semp, was an artist and designer, whose talents spanned across multiple mediums and disciplines.  His visual art is included in private collections in the US, Europe and Asia.  He was an effervescent aesthete with an infectious confidence and a lust for life, often inspiring others with his own philosophies.  A sophisticated palate and raconteur, generous and people-loving, he was always eager to share a story or a meal.  Uncommon, dripping with charm and never without a glint of mischief in his eyes, those who crossed his path would find him hard to forget. 

Philippe was a devoted and doting husband, an imaginative and affectionate father, as well as a loyal and caring friend. He passed away September 19th, 2020 in Dallas, Texas, with his wife and daughter by his side, at home on ""the compound"" under which flows Turtle Creek.  He was loved by many and will be deeply missed.  A small and private ceremony will be held to commemorate him this weekend.
 
Philippe is survived by his beloved wife Patricia, his daughter Camille Anais of Paris (France), his son Cyril, and wife, Virginie and grandson, Gatsby of Paris (France).  
His sister Michelle Costanza of Nevada City, CA and numerous nieces and nephews.

109,110,James Tony Goolsby,"James Tony Goolsby died on September 4, 2020 in Dallas, TX surrounded by his family after a courageous battle against cancer. Born on November 9, 1933, in Colbert, Oklahoma, Tony was raised by Thelma and Herman Ross in Longview, Texas where he graduated from Longview Highschool in 1951. Tony served in the United States Army where he was stationed in Panama, after which he earned a Bachelor of Science in Education from the University of North Texas in 1961 where he was a member of Theta Chi Fraternity. Tony eventually settled in the Dallas metro area where he lived for the rest of his life.

Tony met Toppy Tannery at Lovers Lane United Methodist Church where Tony was an usher and Toppy was always late to church. Even though Toppy wasn’t exactly sure which usher Tony was when he called her, they went on a first date to Pietros on February 18, 1971. They were married on September 18, 1971 and together they raised three daughters and 5 female dogs. For 48 years, Tony and Toppy built a beautiful life together weathering the hard times and celebrating the good times with family and friends. Tony loved being a father to daughters and could be found surprising them at lunch in elementary school, videotaping dance performances and running to the drug store at 2 am when they weren’t feeling well.   
A man of many talents, Tony’s career was wide and varied. After working as a teacher, coach and principal in Celeste, TX, he worked as a pharmaceutical rep, before he opened an Independent Insurance Agency in the 1980s. He successfully ran his small business for over 20 years, being able to personally point out which homes he insured while driving around Dallas. 

In 1988, Tony was elected to the Texas House of Representatives representing North Dallas and Richardson, where he served for 20 years. Tony was a Republican who worked with all legislators to do what was right for Texas. As a legislator, Tony’s priorities were education, protecting victims, and supporting small businesses. He worked to protect victims of sexual assault, strengthen the reach of Amber Alerts, increase accessibility to higher education, protect consumers from unwanted solicitations, cut taxes for small business, and establish identity theft as a state crime. 

Tony was a leader in the Texas House of Representatives where he served as Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, as Vice Chairman of the Committee on Higher Education and as member of various committees including; the House Committees on Licensing and Administrative Procedures, Judiciary, Pensions and Investments, Land and Resource Management, Elections and Liquor Regulation.

Tony loved helping Texans and being in the legislature and he continued to work in Austin as a lobbyist from 2008 up until the time of his death. Tony was a member of too many organizations to name and held many leadership positions throughout the years. Notably, he was President of the Independent Insurance Agents of Dallas, a member of the Board of Directors at Pavillion Bank for 23 years, and the Head of Political Actions for Independent Insurance Agents of Texas. 

Although he never officially “retired,” Tony and Toppy spent the last decade traveling with family and friends including driving through the Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, spending Thanksgivings in Hawaii and Costa Rica, taking riverboat cruises in Europe and visiting their granddaughters in California. 

Tony’s faith as a Christian was central to his life. A member of Lovers Lane United Methodist Church for over 50 years, Tony was generous with his time and resources. In 2001, he and Toppy dedicated the Goolsby Chapel at University of North Texas as a place for people of all faiths to gather for quiet reflection, prayer, meditation, religious services, weddings, or memorials. They also created the Toppy and Tony Goolsby Family Trust Rangerette Scholarship at Kilgore College to assist Rangerettes with their financial needs. For the past 10 years, Tony and Toppy served breakfast at The Bridge Homeless Recovery Center in Dallas where Tony particularly liked working at the sausage station. 

Tony’s favorite hobby was his friendships. He has kept up with and continued to love high school friends, army friends, friends from college, the apartments he lived in when he was single, insurance industry associates, church friends, people he served with and worked with in the legislature, and neighborhood friends. He loved talking to his friends, picking up the phone in restaurants to the chagrin of his family. His quick wit and sense of humor always got a laugh, but there was never a more loyal friend than Tony. It didn’t matter if you were on top of the world or down on your luck, you knew you could count on Tony to be there. He made a lasting impact on everyone he called a friend.

Over the course of his career, he received the American Cancer Society's Texas Advocacy Award (for outstanding legislative leadership in the fight against cancer), the Mirabeau Lamar Award (Texas Freemasons), North Texas State University Outstanding Greek Alumni, Dallas Police Association Award, Longview High School Distinguished Alumni, Kilgore College Ex Student of the Year, Fighter & Champion for Free Enterprise Awards from the Texas Association of Business, Legislator of the Year Award from the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, Legislative Hall of Fame Award from the Texas Association of Realtors, Pillar of Hope Award from the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, Legislator of the Year Award from Retailers for Theft Prevention, Legislative Initiative for Nurturing Children Award from Children's Medical Center, Leadership for Kids Award from the Coalition for North Texas Children, Distinguished Service Award from the Texas Chamber of Commerce, Outstanding Conservative Legislator Award by the National Center for Policy Analysis, Dallas City Council Certificate of Commendation, Texas Realtors Association Award, Fighter for Free Enterprise by the Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce, Texas Pediatric Society Child Advocacy Award, and the Texas Loss Prevention Legislator of the Year from Wal-Mart.

Tony is survived by his wife, Toppy Goolsby of Dallas, TX, his children, Mellie Mathis and her husband Chris Duncan of Dallas, TX, Cherrie Wysong and her husband Jay of Dallas, TX, Brooke Welch and her husband Sean of Oakland, CA, his grandchildren, Delaney and Riley Welch of Oakland, CA, his sister Marsha Ross of Longview, TX and numerous nieces and nephews. He is predeceased by his brother Eddie Goolsby (April 28, 2014). Tony is also survived by his beloved dog, Prissy, who was faithfully by his side until the end. 
Due to the COVID pandemic, the family will have a private burial at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, TX. A livestream of the service will be available. A celebration of life in Dallas will be planned when all who loved Tony can safely gather. 

The Goolsby family would like to give a special thank you to Tony's wonderful caregivers from Baylor Scott and White Plano (Dr. Philip Kovoor, Dr. J.D. Bondy, Dr. Shrawan Gaitonde, Dr. Rassa Shahidzadeh, and Dr David Kim:, Faith Prebysterian Hospice (Stellah & Keisha), Visiting Angels (Shelli), Acapella (Blessing, Idongesit, Darlene, Anne, Tereza, Eunice, Ann, Dianna, Laurie). Tony was blessed to have these dedicated health professionals care for him this past year. Their compassionate and loving care made a difficult situation a little bit more bearable. 

In lieu of flowers, Tony’s family asks that donations be made to one of the organizations listed on the obituary that have special meaning to the Goolsby family.  

Tony’s legacy is his devotion to family, friends and faith and his service to the State of Texas. Tony’s life and impact will not be forgotten if we follow Tony’s words: “Always remember to keep your head screwed on straight.”

114,115,Eric Lopez,"In loving memory of the greatest husband, father,  son, cousin, brother, uncle, friend, and grandfather we could have ever asked for. 

Eric Lopez was born in Salamanca Guanajuato Mexico and learned that life was hard and he had to fight to be something special. He left his home at a young age to have a better life and met his wife along the way. They had 4 beautiful children that lead to 9 grandchildren that were his whole world. He was always worried about giving his all and best to his family, working hard everyday of his life so we could have everything we needed. He rarely got time for himself and his wife would always tell him he needed time off. 

She wanted to travel with him and see the ocean and he wanted to see the Grand Canyon. He finally went on vacation for the first and last time with his wife after almost 34 years of marriage. They traveled to several different states on their trip and he told her “you said you wanted to the the ocean and I brought you to one of the best ones, you wanted to go to a casino and I took you to Vegas, I wanted to see the Grand Canyon and drive on Route 66 and it finally happened now I can die knowing we did what we always wanted to.” She told him he was crazy but we believe he knew what God had planned for him. 

One week later he fell ill and after fighting for 2 months he passed on the 28th of August 2020. 

We will always remember him for his love of music and his beautiful voice. He never let us be sad he would always have the best jokes to make us laugh and told us how much he loved us everyday. In honor of his memory we will keep fighting on through these hard times. 

We will also be holding a viewing from 4:00pm - 9:00pm on Saturday, September 5, 2020 and from 6:00pm - 9:00pm on Sunday, September 6, 2020 at Merit Memorial Funeral and Cremation Care, 12801 N. Stemmons Freeway #803 Farmers Branch, Texas, United States 75234.

Albert, beloved husband, father, and Papa drew his last breath on August 27, 2020. A devoted church fan, and avid supporter of his local communities, he died peacefully with his wife Gloria Young by his side. Albert mainly grew up in the south where he no doubt gained his many craftsman skills working long days with his father Tommy.

He could make anything from scratch and no blueprint from cabinets to garages. He enjoyed good music, was involved in the local Church and community, and was a man of Faith.

Albert was always well dressed, yet, practical. He enjoyed a perfectly pressed suit and a stitched bottom wingtip, each time-finding the tie and handkerchief to compliment. He loved nothing more than Sunday morning service and Bible study. Aside from service you could find Albert in good spirits if there was a good meal around, southern food often feed his soul. Albert developed a passion for home renovations and creative projects where he thrived seemingly more than anywhere else. 

Albert married three times: to the union of his 1st wife T. Thomas (deceased) were born Loretta (deceased), Alan & Joel; to the union of his 2nd wife Flossie Jones (deceased) were born Joyce, Anthony (deceased), Steven, Linda, Cynthia, Lori, David, Kim & Sherri; and to the union of his 3rd wife Gloria Johnson were born Alvira (deceased), Albert Jr, Sertrina, Joshua & Isaiah.

116,117,Patricia Greene,"Patricia A. “Pat” Greene (nee Williams), age 79, passed away peacefully in her home surrounded by loved ones on Wednesday evening, August 26, 2020, after courageously battling Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as  Lou Gehrig’s disease.

Pat was the eldest child of Ralph Lee and Mary Ann (Levy) Williams, born on May 19, 1941, in St. Louis, MO.  She graduated from Maplewood - Richmond Heights High School in 1959.  On February 13, 1960, she married her beloved high school sweetheart, Dick Greene, with whom she recently celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary.  They moved to Dallas, TX in 1963 where they raised two children, Richard Greene and Dana Greene.

Pat wore many hats and touched numerous lives over the years.  Some in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch area will remember her as the school crossing guard that greeted them each morning with her warm and gracious smile.  Others may have fond memories of buying their first bike from the family-owned “Raleigh Bicycle Centre” where she always had her Welsh Corgi, Cricket, in tow.  However, there is no doubt that she touched the most lives in her twenty-plus-year career at Scherer/ Colgate Palmolive in Sales and Human Resources.  Her office had a revolving door where she always found time to offer not only professional but personal guidance, counsel, wisdom, and support to all that sought it from her.  

Pat’s family is what she valued and treasured above all else.  The most precious time in her life began almost 26 years ago when she became a grandmother or as most of you know “Babu!”  She was a tremendous grandmother to Sarah and always kept things real.  She not only taught but demonstrated that each of us must live our lives fully with purpose, passion, confidence, and love.  She was involved and supported Sarah in all her activities from Brownies to ballet.  She shared and instilled her love of travel and the arts.  But the best trait she passed on to her granddaughter, which she had gotten to witness, was her legendary spirit which was and is an undeniable, incontestable, and unwavering force to be all you can be and stay true to yourself.   

After retirement, Pat and Dick enjoyed traveling the country to dog shows in their RV.  She loved her fur babies and grandbabies, especially her Border Terriers.  She took great pride in supporting Dick in competing in Earthdog Trails, Confirmation, and Obedience, in which their dogs became champions.  Their Border Terrier family has been a tremendous support to them over the years as they both battled health issues.  Pat and Dick also became very involved with their church family in their retirement years.  Finding both purpose and support through their involvement.  

She was a woman with many long-term friendships she cherished.  She still kept in touch with several childhood friends but many of her Dallas friendships date back over 60 years.  She had several close circles of friends which ranged from bible study to Al-Anon to her ladies dinners.  She also had her traveling buddies who were always up for an adventure.  They loved cruises and traveling through Europe. Her favorite place to visit was NYC.  She spent a lot of time in NYC because of her career and Sarah’s summer ballet camps.  Her eyes always sparkled when she spoke of NYC and you could see how much she loved the energy, broadway musicals, plays, and art museums, but the best part of NYC, which she took great pride in, was getting to share it with Sarah.  

Pat is survived by her husband, Dick Greene; son, Richard Greene and daughter-in-law Susan, daughter, Dana Greene, and two grandchildren: Gaberial Greene and Sarah Bulba, along with many nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends.  

In June 2019 Pat was diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.  It would be wrong to say she lost her battle with the disease because she never stopped fighting.  Instead, she surrendered to it and lived each day with grace and dignity.  No matter how she felt, she was always determined.  As her body weakened, her spirit strengthened, faith deepened, and zest for life never wavered.  

She will always be carried in the warmest parts of our hearts.  We will honor her every time we are brave, witty, chase dreams, love fiercely, enjoy travel, live as art because her example has inspired us all.  

The family wishes to thank the physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals at UT Southwestern Medical Center, Willow Bend Family Medicine, and Aspen Home Health for their care and dedication.  In addition to the support, we have received from other ALS families, MDA, ALS Association of Texas, and The ALS Living Fund.  But most importantly we must thank God for connecting us with the caretakers that made this journey possible.  They will forever hold a special place in our hearts and I know like many of us fell in love with her.   

The family has requested In lieu of flowers, please make donations in Pat’s memory to The ALS Living Fund, either online or by mail to 7454 Fossil Ridge Drive, Frisco, TX 75034. This organization supported and guided Pat and her family from the beginning to the end, we cannot give back or thank them enough.

122,123,Edmund Patschull,"Edmund’s story: 

My name is Edmund Anthony Patschull and I was born in Chicago, Illinois on July 17th, 1944. I passed away in Dallas, TX on August 21, 2020. My parents, Leo A. P. and Gertrude P. passed away in August of 1957 and in December of 1999 respectively. My three older brothers Frank, George, and Leo passed in 1993, 2017, and 2019. We were born in the same order that we passed. My wife Barbara Allen passed away in May 2016. 

I attended Pope Saint John Paul II School in Chicago, Illinois, through 8th grade and graduated from high school in 1962. I served with the Navy Patrol Squadron 45 for two years during the Vietnam war from 1964 until receiving an honorable discharge in 1966. Thanks to the insistence of my wife, I graduated again, much later, with a bachelor’s in accounting from the University of Texas at Dallas on May 19th, 1984! I received this degree while already in an established career and days before my firstborn child! 

My established career was with Electronic Data Systems (EDS) where I retired from after working for over 40 years as a Capacity Planner. It was at EDS that I met Barbara, the love of my life and first girlfriend, whom I married on May 24th, 1975. I had always dreamed of being a father and was not sure it would happen until my wife got pregnant at 38 years old and gave birth to my daughter, Cynthia Patschull, on May 27th, 1984! The moment my daughter was born my wife yelled out to me from the hospital bed, “I want another one!”. That wish also came true when my son, Matthew Patschull, was born three years later on June 29th, 1987. On April 20th, 2020 my granddaughter Presley Patschull was born, making me a grandfather! My greatest accomplishment in my life is my kids; I loved being a father, a grandfather, and a husband. I also loved my family and friends dearly and enjoyed helping by offering my love and support any time it was needed.

I loved sports and played on an adult softball league and tennis league with my wife and friends into my 50’s. I was an avid Chicago White Sox baseball fan and Chicago Bears football fan. I would beat heavily on my legs when excited over my team scoring! I had a wonderful sense of humor and enjoyed taking part in and laughing at pranks played by my wife, children, brothers, and friends. I always chose to see the positive in people and it showed in my daily interactions with friends, family, and strangers. 

My service will be held at Merit Memorial Funeral Home in Farmers Branch, TX on September 6th, 2020 with Bishop Alfredo officiating. My family will receive friends during visitation at 12:00pm. The funeral service will be held directly following at 2:00pm. 

Memorial contributions may be made in my wife’s honor to: Center for Brain Health at The University of Texas at Dallas, 2200 West Mockingbird Lane, Dallas, Texas, 75235, 214-905-3007. Additionally, contributions may also be made in my honor to: Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research, 1820 W. Webster Ave., Ste 304 Chicago, Illinois 60614, 312-341-0500.

A celebration of her life will be held in the near future.
She was an amazing and talented woman who loved deeply, faced life with strength and dignity, and overcame many obstacles with grace and determination. She will be greatly missed.
To me, her son, this woman was a hero. A true American success story. Born in the slums of Washington D.C. in 1926, she survived the depression with worn out shoes and an alcoholic father. She made wooden models of enemy aircraft used for shadow identification for pilot training during World War II. A secretary for a high-ranking military officer in the Pentagon. Raised two children with little or no help from our father. There was always a roof over our heads and food on the table. A God-fearing woman that found it easy to laugh. She made friends everywhere she went. The world is a lesser place without her."

132,133,Mary Ellen Robledo,"                                                        Mary Ellen Donald-Robledo 1934 - 2020 (Obituary)

Mary Ellen Donald-Robledo passed away and went to be with our Lord, August 3rd, 2020 in Dallas, Texas at the age of 86.

Mary is survived by her son, Thomas Rouse, granddaughter, Brooklynn Rouse, both of Plano, Texas and by her brother, Thomas Donald of Las Vegas, Nevada.  She is preceded in death by her husband, Joe Robledo of Los Angeles, and sisters, Lucille Frances Donald of Los Angeles, Lillian Bush of Las Vegas, Nevada and Leonon Bettencourt of Los Angeles.

Mary was born “Baby Donald” (as shown on her birth certificate) on July 8, 1934 in San Antonio, Texas to parents Julia Marie Holley-Donald and Thomas Donald. After a Catholic baptism as an infant, she acquired her first and middle name.  Mary attended high school at John C. Fremont High in Los Angeles.  After high school, Mary moved with her mother, brother and step-father (Ed Blackwell) to Kalispell, Montana for a brief stay, but returned to Los Angeles alone at the age of 18.  During this time, she came very close to going into the Catholic order called the Sisters of Loretto.  In 1952, one of her first jobs was at the Paramount Theatre in downtown Los Angeles working concessions.  While working there, she greatly enjoyed watching, for free, the many show business entertainers of her time.  For instance,

 Xavier Cugat with Abbe Lane and Nat King Cole.  As time passed, she would develop the skills of a PBX Operator, working for the likes of the StarDust Hotel in Las Vegas and the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) as a “Ship to Shore” operator (which required a US Government Security Clearance.)  In April 1959, she was blessed with the birth of her son, Thomas.  Mary often said that her son was the best thing that ever happened to her and glad she had a boy.  She named her son after her brother, Thomas Donald.  In September 1964, she married Joe Robledo, a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deputy.  During the 1970s, she concentrated on being a wife and mother.   In 1987, she made the decision to move back to Texas and remained there, forming many life-long friends in the Plano area, while living with her only son and granddaughter.  Mary never knew a stranger and was loved very dearly by everyone that met her.  She was a devoted Christian, and would often say that she was ready to meet the Lord Jesus at any time.  She was conservative in her thinking and dress.

Mary was an accomplished singer which began at the age of 5 in Eugene-Springfield, Oregon.  She sang for the Lion’s Club after her family left San Antonio in 1937.  She knew approximately 100 songs at the age of 5.  After moving with her family to Los Angeles in 1940, she continued singing on stage, sometimes as a torch singer, and joined the Roy Gordon Starlets at the Million Dollar Theatre.  She would also sing on stage for WWII soldiers while they were on leave in the Los Angeles area.  As time progressed, she developed an operatic voice under a professional “voice coach” by the name of Miss Liverett.  Mary trained for (and was considered) a “coloratura soprano” and sounded just like Katheryn Grayson in the movie “Showboat.”   Mary loved the opera “Porgy and Bess” and could sing many parts to that opera.   The Metropolitan Opera in New York was also a favorite of hers, especially, when they had stage appearances in Los Angeles.   Although she never reached the billboard notoriety of a star, she was none-the-less greatly admired for her skill by family, friends and professionals.  At one point, she wrote heart-felt songs and put music to them…   keeping all her lyrics and music in her memory.  She continued to pursue singing well into the 1960s.

For most of her life she was a devout Catholic, but in the late 1970s, started watching Christian television and began attending a Four-Square Pentecostal church in Burbank, California.  After moving to Texas, she began attending Hunters-Glen Baptist Church in Plano, until arthritis affected her ability to walk and dementia began to set in.

She was a devoted mother, grandmother, sister and aunt to all of her nieces and nephews, always willing to give of her heart and time.  She loved her friends dearly and loved meeting new people.  Her last big outing was to a Christmas Celebration in December 2019 at the Collin County Historical Society and Museum in McKinney, Texas where her son works.  There, at the age 85, she met the many dear people that work with her son and greatly enjoyed speaking with many of them.  They instantly fell in love with her.   She will be greatly missed by many people.

Family:

Before Christmas, 1988, 3-year old Bryan asked his mom for a coin and tossed it into a wishing well in Longview, TX, asking Jesus for a ‘fire engine’ with “lights and whistles.”  Christmas came and went then in March his mom and baby brother Jon Jon drove to Austin to visit his Nana.  Nana knew nothing of his wish but had bought him a ‘fire engine’ with “lights and whistles” for Christmas setting the gift aside until they could see each other.  When Bryan opened this gift, his eyes lit up and he excitedly jumped up saying, “Thank you Jesus for my ‘fire engine’ with “lights and whistles.”  His mom then explained to Nana what a big deal it was to him since he had tossed the coin in the fountain along with the wish!  A big miracle for a three year old boy!

“Bryan was such a sweet and loving person. He loved food, friends and family. He always wanted to protect me and didn’t want me to worry about him.  When he was little, he could not protect me, but throughout this very trying time, he did what he could to protect me for as long as he could.  He loved helping others and being part of whatever was going on. With his first job, he bought clothes for his brothers!  From the time Bryan was born he brought such joy and love to my heart!  My son, my firstborn, I will always and forever love you deeply!”  - Mom, Carrollton, TX


“Bryan, a very handsome 6’1” young man, had personality plus, a very giving heart,  and loved jumping in to help whenever he saw a need.  He was a very intelligent and creative young man.  He loved planting seeds and watching plants grow!  Recently, he couldn’t wait to show me the beans he planted that were coming up!  Bryan was deeply loved!  Wonderful Grandson I will miss greatly!” – Nana, Dallas, TX

“No matter where he went, he always took enough joy to share with everyone and had a smile that lit up an entire room!” – Aunt Dana, McDade, TX

“Bryan’s first pair of Nike tennis shoes were so tiny and given to him by his Nana when he was two years old.  They were white with a blue stripe with Velcro closures!”   - Aunt Shonda, Georgetown, TX

“When I was at my lowest point mentally and at a crossroads in multiple areas in life, i.e., friends, money, career and life choices generally, I begin spending many weekends in Dallas staying with Bryan and Jon Jon.  These visits helped me get out of my hole with Bryan helping me realize how I needed to enjoy the little things, living life in the now, and enjoying every moment with the people I am with.  Bryan helped me get out of depression to become motivated again.”– Jake Boyce (friends since Age 7), Longview, TX

“Bryan was caring, sweet, loving, understanding and a supportive partner. His love was encompassing. He would share whatever he had with everyone to make sure they felt welcomed and comfortable.  Bryan encouraged everyone to go after what they wanted and to stand tall which was probably easier to do for a 6 foot tall man than for some.  He loved spending time with his cat, Gabriel, watching movies, and trying new foods.  He dreamed of exploring far off places and living life to the fullest.”  - Partner Lauren Falcon, Significant Other, Dallas, TX

140,141,Jared Hardy Decker,"Jared Hardy Decker, beloved husband, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin, and friend to many, passed away in Dallas, Texas, on July 27, 2020, at age 47.   

Jared was born to Alison and Craig Decker on November 2, 1972, in Los Angeles, California and was raised in Southern California and the greater area of Salt Lake City, Utah. Jared was the third oldest in a family that would grow to 15 children. Although he was one of many, Jared’s exceptionally sweet and often equally mischievous nature ensured that he was never lost in the pack. The bonds he shared with his siblings influenced the kind and generous nature he possessed throughout life.  

From 1992 to 1994, Jared served as a missionary in Bogotá, Colombia and surrounding areas, with a brief stint spent in New York. Jared greatly admired the people and culture of Colombia, and for the rest of his life he fluently spoke Spanish whenever he could. In 2002, Jared graduated from the University of Tampa with a B.S. in Management Information Systems, and in 2006, he received his M.B.A. from the University of Houston. He subsequently built two successful consulting companies specializing in business analytics and was a published author on topics of data science and business intelligence. Most importantly to Jared, he served as a mentor to many in their careers.

In March 2008, in Dallas, Texas, Jared met his wife-to-be, Sarah Elizabeth Moore, who he thereafter referred to as “my Sarah.” On November 14, 2009, Jared and Sarah married on the beach in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Inseparable from nearly day one, together they travelled the world, raised a menagerie of dearly loved pets, contributed to each other’s successes, and supported each other through life’s ups and downs.

Jared was well known for his exceptional talent for music. He was a classically trained guitarist who also had a talent for piano and violin and loved to host music nights with family and friends. He will be remembered by his generous nature and the warm spirit he brought wherever he went and whatever the circumstances. Through his relentless optimism and sheer force of will, Jared fought a remarkable 7-year battle against brain cancer, during which time he furthered advancements in science by participating as the first person to receive new drug therapies in three separate clinical trials at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Whether it was cancer or any other obstacle he faced, Jared did so with a unique grace, and he never backed down from a challenge. 

Jared is preceded in death by his mother, Alison. He is survived by his wife, Sarah; his father and step-mother, Craig and Margie; his mother-in-law, Katherine Paulson; his 14 siblings, Annie Tran Dinh, David Tran, Amy Tran, Nathan, Alison Russell, Rachel Clifford, Joshua, Jacob, Maren, Hyrum, Elizabeth Caradine, Seth, Laura Peterson, and Clare Thomas; and by many nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles and cousins.
 
Plans for a Celebration of Life will be announced at a later date due to the current limited ability to host gatherings during COVID-19.

143,144,Ronnie Lynn Irwin,"Ronnie Lynn Irwin passed peacefully surrounded by family and friends on Friday, July 24th in Dallas, Texas at the age of 70 years old.  

Ronnie is survived by his wife of 48 years, Beth Irwin of Dallas; children, Meredith Liner and her husband Kyle of Dallas, Jeffrey Irwin and his wife Natalie of Dallas; beloved grandchildren, Caden and Reese Liner; siblings, Garland Irwin and his wife Jeanne, and Elaine Hale and her husband Mark, both of Henderson, Texas.  He is also survived by his much-loved dog Cody, who was the co-captain of his boat. He is preceded in death by parents, Wilton and Lillian Irwin of Henderson, Texas.  

Ronnie was the youngest child of Wilton and Lillian Irwin, born on November 23rd in Henderson, Texas.  He graduated from Henderson High School in 1968 and married his beloved high school sweetheart, Beth in 1972.  Ronnie enlisted in the Army in 1971 and served overseas in Germany until 1974.  He was awarded The Army Commendation Medal for meritorious service in the 56th Field Artillery Brigade.  After discharge, Ronnie moved to Denver, where he began a 28-year career working for Federal Express as one of the first five thousand employees.  Ronnie was often known to selflessly deliver packages to others late into Christmas Eve, meaning Beth regularly received IOUs as her Christmas gifts!  

Ronnie and Beth made their long-term home in San Antonio, Texas where their two children grew up. Ronnie was an enthusiastic Spurs fan and treasured his collection of the team’s five championship hats.  He avidly rooted for Meredith’s short middle school volleyball career and supported countless fundraisers for her high school dance team.  Ronnie coached Jeffrey’s little league baseball teams and helped him develop his successful golf game, at the expense of one Suburban window which Jeff “caught that a little thin”.  Though he attended Texas Tech University, he had wanted to be an Aggie and was thrilled both his children attended Texas A&M.  His children remember him as a gentle and patient father who provided endless support and encouragement.  

Ronnie was a dedicated husband and hardworking provider for his family.  However, after his retirement at 55, the best part of his life began, that of Poppy!  He was a tremendous grandfather to Caden and Reese from babies to teens; pushing them on swings, teaching Caden to fish, and cheering at their sporting events.  It was also after retirement that Ronnie realized another dream, living at Lake Cherokee where he and Beth spent summers as teens.  Beth and Ronnie built a beautiful home on the south shore of the lake and cherished the friendships they established in their drum circles, boat rallies, and porch dinners.  Ronnie was also a dedicated member of the Church at Lake Cherokee.  

In 2015 Ronnie was the recipient of a lung transplant that provided him five more years with his family.  The selfless gift of the Matthews family will never be forgotten, and as such, donations are welcome to Southwest Transplant Alliance Foundation at Southwest Transplant Alliance, 5489 Blair Rd.

She successfully completed her Elementary and high school education there before migrating with her parents to Michigan, USA in 2000. Here began the journey, a pursuit of studies which ultimately led not just to a profession, but the passion of her heart, nursing, a call to be of service to others.

While serving at several hospitals from Michigan to Massachusetts to Florida, wherever Abishai went, be it on call or off duty the Lord used her to touch the lives of many by her love, caring and selfless concern for others. 

Six years ago, at age 30, a battle with cancer arose. Abishai pressed through it all undaunted and unrelenting in spite of the severe pain and suffering during the period. On July 6th 2020 after the Lord appeared to her, Abishai accepted His call to come home, and on July 10th 2020 she transitioned from time to eternity.

Abishai is survived by her parents, Robert and Natalie Greene (residing in the US), Patrick St. John (residing in Trinidad), her brothers and sisters (Rae Ella, Abigail, Hammon, Nathan and Tabitha), five nieces and four nephews, her fiance Duayne, family members and several friends. She poured out her love towards the lives of so many, and now in her transition, she is in the awesome presence of Almighty Father where she is receiving the fullness of his love and blessings.

Bob passed away peacefully on the afternoon of June 18, 2020 at his Dallas home.  He was in the loving embrace of his family when he departed.  

Bob was born on November 24, 1941 in Jacksonville, Texas, Tomato Capitol of the World and childhood home.  Jacksonville was near to his heart as were his high school classmates with whom he recently celebrated his 60th reunion.  Bob was often a passionate organizer of this annual tradition and took immense pleasure in reuniting with his graduating class, remembering fondly the innocent and joyous days of youth they shared. 

Graduating college in 1963, Bob attained a bachelor's degree in Economics from Rice University whereupon he was recruited by IBM and subsequently enjoyed lengthy career in the computer industry, helping to pave the way for a revolution in personal and commercial computing that shaped our modern world.  Following his retirement in 2000, he became a substitute teacher at Hillcrest High School in Dallas and was honored to work alongside a plethora of talented  and dedicated educators.

Bob was gifted with an inimitable spark of life and carried an inexhaustible love for the world and its people.  There was nothing in this world so mundane that his touch would not make it magical.  He was adored and respected by all who knew him.  No part of him will be unmissed; his laughter, his wisdom, his loyalty, his courage, not even his puns.  

The world is a richer and more beautiful place for having been touched by his spirit.  As we bid him farewell on his journey, through prayer let him know that our hearts are open, there is a seat at our table, and a loving embrace waiting with those of us he touched and in whom he lives on.

160,161,Mary Joyce Klopack,"        Mary Joyce (“Mary Jo”) Klopack passed away peacefully on Monday, June 15, 2020.  She was 84.
        Born in North Dakota on October 21, 1935, to Clara and Ole Berg, Mary Jo had one sibling, her older brother, Clayton, whom she adored. 
        One of Mary Jo’s most dramatic early memories occurred when the family was living in California.  On July 17, 1944, munitions being loaded onto a cargo vessel in Port Chicago exploded, killing over 320 sailors and civilians.  The blast blew out the windows of the family home, leaving Clay and Mary bloodied and frightened.  The young family relocated to Tamarack, Minnesota to take up farming with other kin. 
        Mary Jo graduated from McGregor High School in 1953.  Just eighteen years old, she left the farm to live and work in Minneapolis.  At twenty-one, Mary Jo jumped at the opportunity to work as a civilian contractor in Okinawa, Japan.  There she met a young Air Force officer, Bernard Klopack, who relentlessly pursued Mary Jo until she agreed to marry him.  The wedding took place on June 24, 1961.  Living in Coon Rapids, Scott Michael was born, quickly followed by Cheryl Ann.  
        In 1967, Bernie’s job took the family to Plano, Texas, a suburb of Dallas.  Two years later, Kevin Allen became the fifth member of the family. 
        Mary Jo became a court reporter and eventually taught court reporting.  With this background, Mary Jo became a trainer for Rockwell Collins where she spent many years in the Human Resources Department.   Despite her success at Rockwell Collins, Mary Jo always felt a strong compulsion to get her degree.  Thus, while working full time and raising a family, Mary Jo worked tirelessly for her bachelor’s degree in business from Dallas Baptist University in 1993, one of her proudest achievements. 
        However, anyone who spent more than ten minutes with Mary Jo quickly learned her true passion – her family.  She was totally devoted to her children, never missing a ball game or cheer event.  Whenever possible, the family was boating on Lake Texoma where many memories were made.  Every weekend of boating was capped off by root beer floats on the way home from the lake. 
        The love of family was not limited just to the immediate family.   Although separated by many miles, Mary Jo adored Clay and his incredible wife, Helen, and their amazing girls, Debbie, Pam, and Karen.   Bernie’s amazing sister, Pat, always held a special place in Mary Jo’s heart, as did her brother-in-law, Marv.  Mary Jo beamed at being “Aunt Mary” to her handsome nephew, Craig, and beautiful niece, Renee.  
        Although preceded in death by her husband, Bernie, and youngest son, Kevin, Mary Jo was surrounded by family: Cheryl and her husband, Jeff, granddaughters Danielle and Krista, and great-granddaughters Clara and Abigail; Scott and his wife, Janice, grandsons Cody and Ryan as well as Ryan’s wife, Brianne; and many other family members and friends. 
Mary Jo will be greatly missed by those she loved so dearly.

He worked as an Engineer in Training in Tulsa, Oklahoma before later working very successfully as an Associate Property Tax Consultant for Marvin F. Poer and Company, when illness cut a very promising career tragically short.

He enjoyed cooking, golf, bowling, online gaming, fantasy football, baseball, shooting paint ball and air soft guns, attending Dallas Stars hockey, Atlanta Falcons football, Oklahoma State football, and adored his beloved lab mix dog Ringo. He was a highly respected, capable and intelligent team member in every position he held. He was known to be very caring, kind, empathetic, and a “peaceful soul”.  A beloved son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin, friend, co-worker and grandson.  He was a fine young man and will be truly missed by everyone whose lives he touched. 

From a very young age, Taylor was never handed an easy life due to his neurofibromatosis, but courageously overcame many challenges. Alas, he fought bravely without complaint against a cancer that could not be overcome. He was so special and we rejoice in his life.

He was (and is) so loved and missed.

Taylor is survived by his father Randy James Davis, sister Tiffany Johnson, brother-in-law Hunter Johnson, nephew Colton Johnson, and niece Savannah Johnson. He was preceded in death by his loving mother Peggy Diane Davis, grandfather James Davis, grandmother Margaret Brown, grandfather Charles Brown, aunt Connie Morgan, and aunt Patricia Brown.

173,174,Robert Hodgkinson,"A letter to my husband:

My dearest Bobby,

It is said that some couples fall in love at first sight.  When we first met more than 40 years ago, it wasn’t quite like that, was it, honey?  I had never met anyone quite like you.  I thought you were pretty cute, but a little too free-spirited for my taste.   But despite that sort of “wild child” persona on the outside, as you know, it didn’t take long for me to know and fall in love with the true you. 
As so many came to know, you have a heart of gold and with huge compassion, reached out to so many who needed you.  Although my sadness is profound about our time together ending too soon, I am blessed for the many years I did have you as my partner and soulmate.  You brightened my world with laughter, love, and music. You loved my girls as your own.  During difficult days, you lifted me up.   Every day, I will remember that one of the last things you said before leaving me was “I love my wife”.  
As the dreadful illness progressed, you never gave up and to the very end, you fought with extraordinary bravery and resolve to get well.  I’m trying to be selfless and only be happy that now for you there is no more pain and you moved to a glorious everlasting life.  That gives me comfort.  However, I will be missing you every single day for the rest of my life here on earth.  
As one of your many friends put it, you were one of those people who left a beautiful and remarkable imprint on the world, humble, yet significant in all you did.   
      I’ll be in love with you forever, my sweet Bobby.

She was a loving wife to Bill, adoring mother to Martin and Cindy, and blessed “Yia Yia” to her grandchildren and great grandchildren. 

Esther was born March 10, 1932 in Scottsbluff, Nebraska to the late Elpis and Nicolas Peters.  Esther was a graduate of Scottsbluff High School and afterwards courageously came to Dallas, Texas where she worked at Mobil Oil Company and later as a flight attendant for Continental Airlines in the early days of public air travel.

Esther always supported Bill and his football coaching career by caring for his coaches’ wives and his players.  She cared for her community by volunteering and fund raising for various organizations such as Christian Woman’s Club and Fellowship of Christian Athletes.  She served faithfully in her churches and Bible Study Fellowship, working as committee woman, teacher, and friend to all in need. 

There is no doubt Esther loved her family and friends, but most of all she loved her Lord Jesus Christ, who she met at a Billy Graham Crusade in Dallas in early 1954. In health and in illness, she was truly determined to know nothing but Christ and Him crucified.  In her strength and weakness, she was committed to an obedient walk.  As she rested, the Lord showed her great and unsearchable things; she was always a prayer warrior and a witness to the Lord. 

She is survived by her husband of 65 years, Bill, son Martin Yung and his wife Vicki, daughter Cindy and husband James Irlbeck, grandchildren Christin and her husband Travis Rea, Lauren and her husband Brian Giese, Margaret Connor and her husband Cory Hood, and Brooke Yung.  Esther had three great grandchildren who always made her smile: Grace Giese, Colton Rea, and Ella Giese.  She is also survived by her brothers Pat Peters and his wife Adele, Paul Peters and his wife Shirley, her sisters-in-law India Peters and Doris Peters, as well as many nieces, nephews, cousins, and innumerable friends.

The service will be held Monday, May 11, 2020 in Dallas and her burial will be the same day at DFW National Cemetery. Only immediate family will be present in order to protect the health of those she loved.

182,183,Lisa Rowe,"Lisa Lavonne Rowe came to this earth on October 11th, 1963. She was born to Marion Yvonne Glenn and Morris Raymond Young. She went to Heaven Thursday, April 30th, 2020. She is survived by her husband, Steve Rowe; her 5 children, Candid Rowe, Krystin Rowe, Stevie Rowe, Haley Rowe and Harley Rowe; sister, Charlotte Nichols (Mike Nichols); brother, Cody Young; grandchildren, Colby, Ashley and John; nieces and nephews, Michael, Cory, Taylor, Layne, Kasie, Karisa; great nieces and nephews, Brylee, Leah, Gaven, Tatem and also many other family members and friends that loved her so so much. Lisa was a loving wife, mother, sister, and friend. Her family was very important to her. She also enjoyed making candles and other home crafts. She was one of the sweetest souls on this earth and will truly be missed. 

For anyone that knew Lisa, knowns she was loving, caring and a very special angel God gave us. She never has a bad thing to say about anyone; unless you were a cop! I remember, I was driving with my son Layne and her son Stevie. They were both around 3 years old and a cop pulled up beside us. Stevie, all of a sudden starts saying ""cop, dunk""!! He was in his car seat leaning over as far as he could. 
When I took him back to Lisa's I told her what Stevie did and Lisa said, 'Oh, good job baby""!

Lisa also loved shopping for pretty plants and things to put up in her house; so much that Lisa would hide what she would buy so Steve, her husband, wouldn't know. Once Steve would go to bed Lisa would hurry and get her things and put them up or plant her plants, like Steve wouldn't notice. She would always say to Steve how she already had those things.

Lisa was always so pretty and dainty but let me tell you, she had a hard time keeping her balance. It seemed like every time I would see her she would have a new scrape on her little knees. I would always tell her ""baby you need to be careful"" and Lisa would always reply, ""I didn't spill my tea though""!

Lisa was the type of person that would give the shirt off of her back to anyone that needed it. You could say how you loved something that she had and she would say ""here, you can have it"". She was one of the most selfless person that there ever was. Lisa would do anything that there ever was. Lisa would do anything for anyone that she could. Everything about Lisa is going to be truly missed each and everyday. The way she would always say everything was so ""delightful"", her gentle soul, her precious smile. I could go on and on about my sweet little Lisa.

Lisa, I can't say enough about how you were an amazing wife, mother, sister, aunt, sister in law and one of mom and dads most precious babies. Your memories will always and forever be with us. We love you so much Lisa. There aren't enough words to express how you impacted all of our lives. I will see you soon my, baby.

        After the war, Bill completed his education with honors at The Newark of Fine and Industrial Arts and continued on to work full time as an artist where he specialized in oil paintings and murals. Bill’s artwork and commissions allowed him the opportunity to travel the world where his work can be seen from Mexico to London and Italy and back to The USA. One of Bill’s most recognized masterpieces can be seen in The Boston State House where he was commissioned to complete a 10X16 ft mural of George Patton and his troops during WWII in Germany on behalf of the 94th Division and the State of Massachusetts.   
        Bill was also known as an author and wrote Visions From a Foxhole; A Rifleman in Patton’s Ghost Corps, after finding his 50-year-old sketches that he had completed as a soldier while in battle as an 18-year-old. The sketches became his inspiration to write about his experiences along with his comrades of the war during the times he served as a soldier and platoon leader. Bill’s book reached thousands of people across the world who needed closure and understanding on what their families went through and gave Bill the opportunity to speak at many venues; including Brookdale College in NJ, The National Guard Museum, NJ, The Library of Congress, The Pritzker Military Library in Chicago, The Flight Museum in Dallas Texas and the Vernon Museum in Vernon, Texas.

The memorial service will be postponed until August 2020, due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Harold was born November 25, 1941, in Pampa, Gray County, Texas, to Verga (Garton) and Benjamin Holmes. His father died within days of his birth, due to surgical complications. For many years, Harold Wayne lived with his Mamaw Alpha Garton or his Uncle Linnus and Aunt Nettie (Garton) Cates and his cousins: Darryl, Gerald, and Nancy. Most of his childhood stories included these very cousins and lots of crazy antics.

Around the age of 13 or 14, Harold moved back in with his mother and her husband, Roy Binion, who would be wonderful grandparents to both of his children until they preceded him in death in 1994 and 1997, respectively.

He grew up between Booker and Perryton, Texas, graduating from Perryton High School. He was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and was medically discharged following a crash during his tour.

From his first marriage to Elizabeth Montgomery, a son, Kelly Wayne, was born in 1963. Kelly preceded Harold in death in 2016 leaving behind his widow, Tonja (Sanchez) Holmes-Moon; four of Harold’s grandchildren: Christopher and his wife Johanna, Ashleigh, Robbie, and Rebekah; and six great-grandchildren, one great-grandchild having preceded him in death.

From his second marriage to Frances Hamer, another son, Scott William, was born in 1974. Scott and his wife, April (Novack), have three children: Ryan, Lexi, and Rhonda.  
Harold was always known as an excellent salesperson. He sold advertisements for many years and ran his own remodeling company at the time of his death.
 
He enjoyed going to the lake for water skiing or boating, reading science fiction, and playing video games like Colonization. His favorite pastime though was planning and maintaining his saltwater fish tanks. He could get things to thrive in his tanks that professional aquariums struggled with.

He loved to serve on the security teams at the churches he attended both in San Antonio and Wichita Falls. In San Antonio, he was known as “The Candy Man” because he always had a friendly smile and a little treat for the children attending services.

When he entered the hospital, the kids missed him so much that the whole security team took over the “High Five” duties.

Father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and friend, Harold will sorely be missed, but we will see him again in eternity. “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.” John 5:24

199,200,Ollie Brantley,"Athlete, officer of the law, difference-maker in the community, husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle, cousin, friend, mentor, advisor, legend, pioneer, chief…these are some of the many titles you will hear when referring to Ollie Brantley.

Ollie was born on September 16, 1931, the youngest of 9 children born to Essie (Saxton) and Jim Brantley of the Southland community in Phillips County Arkansas. His parents and eight siblings all preceded him in death – Chester, J. B., James, Vireece, Carlos, Zenobia and Ann (Tippie Lee) Brantley.

He grew up in a rural farming community where his parents were sharecroppers. The parents and older siblings worked hard planting, harvesting, and plowing fields for a percentage of the yielded crop to support the family and enable the younger children to go to school and get an education. 

Ollie attended school in the Southland community and West Helena, Arkansas. As a high school star athlete, Ollie excelled in multiple sports but his passion and true athletic gift was in baseball. He caught the attention of the manager of the Memphis Red Sox Negro League organization. At the age of eighteen, Ollie was drafted right out of high school to play baseball.  He headed to Memphis where he signed with the Red Sox in 1951.  Life with the historic Negro League was rewarding but also very challenging, especially on the road as the teams faced ongoing instances of racial prejudice as they traveled the deep south. 

In 1953, the Chicago White Sox organization signed Ollie and bought out his contract after learning what a gem they had discovered in this talented young pitcher. Ollie’s career began with the White Sox organization as the league was beginning to integrate. He displayed the true measure of a man as he bravely endured racial prejudices being the only black man on the team. He would have to eat separately, be housed separately and even be separated from the team transportation and chauffeured in a station wagon to pass through many towns later rejoining the team when it was safe to do so. As Jackie Robinson had done before him, he would have to endure a tedious integration process full of racial discrimination and oppression that existed in society. He was definitely one of the pioneers for black athletes in professional sports. Ollie played with the Chicago White Sox organization through 1960 and followed with another 8 years playing with the Minnesota Twins organization. Ollie retired from professional baseball in 1969.

In 1957, the young baseball player married his bride of 63 years, the beautiful Frances Robins of Marianna, Arkansas. He had first met her many years earlier at a high school basketball game. They started seriously dating after she went off to college. To this union two daughters were born, Beverly and Karen. 

Ollie was a man of faith who accepted Jesus at an early age. Growing up in the Southland community, he joined the Spring Lake Baptist Church. He became a faithful member of Second Baptist Church in Marianna where he attended until he moved to Dallas.

As the end of his baseball career was becoming apparent, during the off-season, Ollie set in motion what would be his next career path. He became a police officer with the Marianna Police Department working as the only black officer on the force and then joined the Lee County Sherriff’s Department as the first black deputy. Once again, he was a trailblazer.  His love for people and helping others made this public service career in law enforcement a perfect fit. He made a difference in countless lives.

Because of his love of the game, Ollie also continued with baseball back in the local community. He built his own baseball park on the land his childhood home once occupied. He assembled a team and acquired support to obtain equipment and uniforms that were needed to “Play Ball”. He managed the team and coordinated a schedule of “home” and “away” games with other regional teams. The community looked forward to Sunday afternoon games.

He was always active in the community, guiding and investing in the youth. He officiated high school basketball games, helped facilitate summer youth work programs and was key in ensuring the small-town minority kids would have an opportunity to play little league baseball and have a community athletic field to play it on. He was especially excited to be able to spark an interest in baseball in these young minds.

He had a passion for expanding opportunities for young people to keep them on the right path. To that end, after leaving the Sherriff’s department he worked as a resource officer with the public school system.

After an extended illness, he transitioned this earthly life on April 5, 2020, in Dallas, Texas where he had resided since 2017.
He is survived by his loving wife of 63 years, Frances Robins Brantley of Dallas, Texas; their daughters, Beverly Brantley and Karen Brantley both of Dallas, Texas; an older daughter, Linda Brantley (Lewis) of Olive Branch, Mississippi; two granddaughters, Kaiesha McGruder (Jessie) of Marion, Arkansas and Kyra Brantley of Denver, Colorado; five great-grandchildren, Alexia McGruder, Jessika McGruder, Julious McGruder, Jeremiah McGruder, and Alijah McGruder all of Marion, Arkansas; one niece,  Deloris Wilson (Andrew) of Sterling Hts, Michigan; one great-niece, Tiffany Brantley of South Bend, Indiana; one sister-in-law, Pearl Brantley of Sterling Hts, Michigan; two brothers-in-law, John D. Robins (Dorothy) of Detroit, Michigan and Wilbur D. Robins of St. Louis, Missouri; their families and a host of nieces, nephews, cousins and friends who will continue to cherish his memory. He will be greatly missed.

As an expression of sympathy, in lieu of flowers and plants, a contribution may be given for the establishment of a college scholarship fund to commemorate his life of service and giving.

Beverly was born in Dallas, Texas on December 5, 1939 to Roscoe and Marian Tipton, and grew up in University Park, Texas.  She graduated from Loretto Heights College in Denver, Colorado.  Shortly thereafter, she met and married her husband of 54 years, Gerald.  Beverly loved to cook for friends and family, volunteered for numerous organizations and was devoted to her family and friends.   

She is survived by her sons, Geoff Doke (Joleen), John Doke (Susan), Chris Doke (Megan), fourteen grandchildren, and many close friends.
 
Beverly is preceded in death by her husband, Gerald Pirot Doke, her father John Roscoe Tipton, DDS and mother Marian Lyndon (Smith) Tipton.

202,203,Gerardo Rodriguez,"Gerardo (Jerry) Rodriguez, 58, passed away peacefully at his home in Frisco, Texas on Friday, March 27, 2020.  He was surrounded by his loving wife, Renee, and his best buddy, son Christopher.  

Jerry was born in Houston, Texas to Olivia and Gilberto Rodriguez, Sr. He received most of his early education in Houston, but also some elementary education in Mexico. He graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School in 1979, and afterwards pursued his interest in engineering, earning his degree from the University of Houston.  

During his more than thirty years in the world of engineering, Jerry left his signature on numerous projects spanning states and countries, including professional buildings, hospitals, museums, restaurants, hotels and entertainment centers.  Some memorable projects, each with a special significance to Jerry, included the Sam Houston Race Park, Texas Children’s Hospital, UCLA Medical, Getty Villa Museum and the George H. Bush Presidential Library. Jerry was a long-time and loyal Dallas Cowboys fan, so he was excited to have had “The Star” as one of his many engineering projects.

To every social gathering with family, friends or even acquaintances, Jerry added his expertise, not only as a sports enthusiast, but also as a wine, beer and food aficionado. He was a devotee of all food channels – he was such a “foodie”.  

Jerry’s quiet and humble Catholic faith brought opportunities for him to engage in activities and behavior that displayed his determination to live the life the Lord would want.  His participation as a Knight of Columbus was an example of how he contributed to so many.  When a suggestion to comfort, celebrate, or spoil was made, Jerry would seldom admit to being the instigator, but his love and kindness was felt by everyone who knew him.

Jerry’s love for his wife Renee was obvious in so many ways, but none more than the way he adopted the Primary Immunodeficiency (PI) community as his own.  Through her journey with rare, chronic illness Jerry was a light that shined, not only in supporting his wife, but many others through his attendance at community events, walks, and simply by his support of her advocacy.  Jerry was an example to all who are supporting a loved one living with chronic illness, and his example gave many, hope.

Jerry’s family would like to thank everyone who offered support, comfort and love in his journey with salivary gland cancer. Your culinary treats, cards, emails and calls showed the encouragement and concern that helped to surround Jerry with light and love when he needed it most.

Our beloved Jerry is survived by his wife, Yvonne Renee Rodriguez, son Christopher Rodriguez, parents Gilberto Sr. and Olivia Rodriguez, brother and sister-in-law Gilberto Jr. and Gloria Rodriguez, in-laws Elizabeth Martinez and Eusebio and Susan Benavidez, Joseph and Lorraine Benavidez, Robert Benavidez and partner Diana Flores, Susana and Greg Voigt, nieces and nephews: Danielle (Rodriguez) and Matthew Clark, Eric Rodriguez and partner Sarah Long, Jasmine Benavidez, Garrett Benavidez, Savanna Voigt, and Annabelle Voigt.  He is mourned by numerous aunts, uncles, cousins, faithful friends and co-workers.

At this time, in view of the medical crisis in our country, services are being held in abeyance.  Services to include a funeral mass and settlement in a columbarium will be announced at a future date.

205,206,James Raymond Noell,"It is with sad, and totally broken-to-pieces, hearts that we tell you that our son, James, lost his life this past weekend. He was just 24.

He fought a long battle with addiction and unfortunately, did not win it.

James was our first-born. He was loved by everyone; easy-going, witty, quick to laugh. He was a smart, immensely talented young man. James loved the outdoors; camping & hiking. He was passionate about music, all genres, but especially the obscure stuff, it was fun learning from him. Tim & James played guitar together; oh, how I’ll miss that and hearing he and the girls sing together.

We will forever miss his grin, his laugh, his great hugs. I will miss watching him graduate college, getting married, having kids. Drugs stole those things from us.
Our girls are devastated. Thankfully they are surrounded by loving friends until we can be together.

To commemorate James; in lieu of the flowers, the Noell Family request that donations be made to Shatterproof. Shatterproof is dedicated to helping reverse the addiction crisis.

209,210,David Kanter,"      Dr. David Kallman Kanter, 82, of Lenox died after a brief illness on March 18, 2020 in Dallas, Texas, while visiting his son. David was born Nov. 2, 1937, in Pittsfield. He was raised by his parents, Sydney and Rose Kanter, and his grandparents Max and Ethel Chesney, who had migrated in the late 1800s from the Russian-Polish border and settled in the Berkshires. Max started the first home milk delivery for Pittsfield. David attended Redfield and Dawes elementary schools, graduated from Pittsfield High School in 1954 and attended the University of Vermont, graduating in 1959. He received his doctor of dentistry from the University of Pennsylvania in 1963.

      He married Dorothy DeCecio of Cliffside Park, New Jersey, and volunteered to serve as a captain in the U.S. Army Dental Corps during the Vietnam War. He served for two years at Fort Ord and Defense Language School in Carmel, California. In 1965 he opened The Dentists LLC, a private practice in Teaneck, New Jersey, to be closer to family.

      As a dentist, David was a perfectionist. As a result, he was invited to teach at Fairleigh Dickinson University dental school. In the early 1980s, he received a special degree as a Fellow of the Academy of General Dentistry. He served his patients, who came to his Teaneck office from all over the New York City metropolitan area, until retiring in 2003 and returning to live in his beloved Berkshires.

      In the Berkshires, he provided free dental care for low-income adults at Volunteers in Medicine in Great Barrington, and served on its board of directors. In and around his historic Lenox home, he spent many hours cultivating beautiful flower and vegetable gardens as well as reading about history and archeology, subjects he enjoyed with a passion.

      He is survived by his wife, Dorothy Kanter; his children: Mark Kanter and wife Heather Hutchison and son Dante, Daniel Kanter and wife Marianne Gargour and sons Giovanni and Nicholas, Elisabeth Kanter Miller and husband Peter Miller and children Carmen and Felix, and Sara Kanter and her sons Liam and Logan Tighe-Kanter.

210,211,Joan Parker,"Born May 27, 1955 at Pemiscot Memorial Hospital in Hayti, MO, Joan Lee Lawrence Parker spent her early years along the banks of the Mississippi River (or “her river,” as she so fondly referred to it) in her beloved hometown of Caruthersville, MO. After graduating from Caruthersville HS in 1973 where she was co-captain of the cheerleading squad, Joan began her lifelong career as an administrative professional at IBP, Inc. in Nebraska City, NE. It wasn’t long, however, before Joan’s noted hatred of winter prompted her to transfer down south to Amarillo, TX. It was here, against the romantic backdrop of a beef-packing plant, Joan met and married a handsome, long-haired rock ‘n roller named Kenneth T. Parker with whom she later had 3 equally handsome rock ‘n roller children named Raychel Anne, Lisa Nicole, and Benjamin Lawrence. Joan eventually took a job at Corporate Systems in Amarillo where she remained employed for 12 years. During this time, she became a Certified Professional Secretary (1987), served as a member of Professional Secretaries International, and exercised her love of softball as second baseman on the company’s coed softball team. After relocating with her family to Carrollton, TX, Joan took a job at a small utility company in Dallas (now called Clearview Energy) where she played a formative role in the company’s tremendous growth and success, and remained a dedicated employee for 18 years up to the time of her death.

A true southern lady, Joan was equal parts sugar and spice with a personality far bigger than her diminutive 4’11” frame. Joan’s beautiful smile was her personal piece of sunshine to everyone who knew her and anyone who met her. The things Joan loved, she loved fervently.  Her magnet collection will tell you how dedicated of a patron she was to Dallas Summer Musicals (Les Misérables being her all-time favorite). Her puppy collection will tell you how dedicated she was to pugs and pug accessories (although she happily welcomed all tail-wagging creatures into her home). Her everything else collection will tell you how much she loved (oh and how she loved) the Oklahoma Sooners.

Following a seven-year battle with cancer, Joan peacefully departed this world on March 17, 2020 surrounded by all her children and her best friend Kenneth. Joan faced her death with the same courage and grace she showed throughout illness, and looked forward to once again seeing her father (Al), mother (Emma), and to reuniting at long last at the Rainbow Bridge with her many beloved pets she cared for over her amazing 64 years.

Joan is survived by two older brothers whom she absolutely adored, Bobby and Skip Lawrence, their wives Susan and Suzanne Lawrence, her stepdaughter Kelly Smith and husband Darrell, beloved furbabies JoJo and Cosette, granddogs Banjo, Blue, Bandit, and Pipsy Von Cheeseburger, grandturtle Hobbes, numerous nieces and nephews (all human), and many dear friends (mostly human). She is also survived by her three adoring children Raychel Parker-Dull (Jeff), Lisa Parker, and Benjamin Parker who will forever and always love and miss their sweet Mommoo more than words could ever express but who take solace in knowing she’s still out there being the same watchful, loving, and protective guardian angel she was to them in life. Finally, Joan is survived by her best friend and life partner Kenneth Parker who provided continuous care and support throughout every stage of Joan’s illness and served as a devoted caregiver in her final months epitomizing their special bond and the enduring love they shared for more than 40 years.

Joan’s family would like to thank the wonderful staff at UT Southwestern Dallas, William P. Clements Hospital, and Pathway Hospice, and would like to give special thanks to her tremendously caring and supportive work family at Clearview Energy.

Memorial services will be held at a later date not yet determined, so in lieu of flowers, the family suggests honoring Joan’s memory in one or all of the following ways:

1.  When you pass a stranger, smile and say hello.

2.  When you see a pug, stop and pet it. (Bonus points for emitting high-pitched squeals while doing so.)

3.  When you hear a song you love, sing along loudly and with feeling.

4.  When you spy someone sporting UT apparel, kick them in the shin and yell “BOOMER SOONER!”

217,218,Carolyn Rose Jenkins,"         Carolyn Rose Gannon Jenkins, 94, passed away on February 25, 2020, at Faith Presbyterian Hospice in Dallas, TX.  Carolyn was born on June 17, 1925, in Arkansas City, KS to James Ernest Gannon and Pearl Mae Merriman Gannon.
         Carolyn grew up in Kansas and Oklahoma. A 1943 graduate of Okmulgee High School (OK), she went on to attend the University of Oklahoma (OU) in Norman, OK, where she received BFA degrees in Broadcast/Drama/Communications in 1946. At OU, Carolyn was a member of Pi Beta Phi Fraternity for Women, and in 2019 was initiated into Pi Phi’s Diamond Arrow Society, honoring 75 years of membership. 
         She began working for CBS in Hollywood during the late 1940’s, then rapidly broke several glass ceilings as one of the first and most sought after female broadcast professionals in the U.S.  Carolyn moved to first Honolulu, HI, then San Francisco, CA, with the Armed Forces Radio Service.  She was quickly slated for a move to Tokyo, Japan, to become one of the first female radio DJ’s, broadcasting for the U.S. Armed Forces.  Fate had other plans, however, as a young USAF Lieutenant Thomas C. Jenkins III proceeded to use his connections to make sure Carolyn Gannon’s flight was always changed or postponed so that he could convince her to marry him.  Carolyn never made it to Japan but did move to Washington, D.C., as newly married Carolyn Jenkins.  She continued to work in radio broadcast for MBS and ABC stations in Washington, D.C. until moving with her family to Tulsa, OK in the 1950’s.
        Carolyn spent decades in Tulsa working in both radio and television broadcasting and with several major advertising agencies. She was one of the Charter Members and Officers for American Women in Radio and Television (AWRT) and helped pioneer and advance the impact of women in electronic media and allied fields during her long and impressive career.  She helped usher in the advent of “Morning Show” variety programming that took off nationwide in 1975, hosting Tulsa, Oklahoma’s own version of “Good Morning America”, known as “Tulsa Morning” on KOTV (CBS).  Carolyn Jenkins retired in 1987 at the age of 62.
        In the 26 years to follow, Carolyn lived a very active life, travelling and enjoying retirement and her grandsons.  She remained in Tulsa until 2003, then moved to Plano, TX to be close to her daughter and youngest grandsons for the last 16 years of her amazing long life.
       Carolyn was preceded in death by husband Thomas Canfield Jenkins III (’96), mother Pearl Mae “Kay” Gannon (’94), and brother Thomas Darrell Gannon (’03).
       Carolyn is survived by son Thomas C. Jenkins IV and wife Marsha of Broken Arrow, OK; daughter Carolyn Janette Jenkins Poston of Plano, TX; grandsons Thomas C. Jenkins V and wife Amanda of Rogers AR; Jackson T. Poston and Gannon R. Poston both of Plano, TX; Great-grandson’s Thomas VI, Wyatt, and Westin of Rogers, AR, as well as beloved nieces and nephews across the US.

230,231,Stephanie Thomas Howard,"Stephanie Thomas Howard, 75, of Dallas, TX, died early Saturday morning, February 1, 2020 at Faith Presbyterian Hospice after a 20 month battle with pancreatic cancer.
Funeral service will be at Preston Hollow Presbyterian Church on Saturday, February 29, 2020 at 11:00 am with Reverend Sarah Are officiating.  Merit Memorial will be handling the funeral arrangements.
Stephanie was born in Spokane, WA to the late Mary B and Sherman Thomas on February 8, 1944, and later that year moved to Vinita, Oklahoma - her beloved hometown.  She graduated Co-Valedictorian from Vinita High School in 1961 and attended Oklahoma University (OU) where she joined Pi Beta Phi sorority.  For the last 20 years she attended annual reunions with her lifelong Pi Phi friends.  Stephanie met her future husband Eddie (Edward Ray Howard Jr.) at OU’s Sooner Scandals in the spring of 1962.  They married June 29, 1963 in Vinita.  Over the next 10 years, she and Eddie lived in 7 cities and had 3 boys before settling in Dallas in 1973.  That same year they became members of Preston Hollow Presbyterian Church (PHPC).  They taught Sunday school, attended the Family Life Class, and joined a PHPC cluster group.  These long time cluster friends have come to be like family.  
Stephanie continued her education earning a BA in History from the University of North Texas and a Masters degree in anthropology from Southern Methodist University.  While working on her doctorate (ABD), her mom became ill.  Stephanie took over her mom’s part time job at Techstyles, Inc. and soon realized how much she enjoyed the business.  When her mom died in 1984, she stopped pursuing her doctorate, started working full time, and became co-owner of Techstyles, Inc.   The family business grew and thrived after Stephanie joined the company.
She supported numerous arts and charitable organizations and volunteered with NEXUS, where she had many Nexus volunteer friends.  She highly valued knowledge and education and was an avid reader.  She traveled extensively: summiting Mount Kenya with her girlfriends; tracking the African mountain gorillas with Eddie; exploring Alaska in an RV; and traveling internationally with best friends, Jeff and Anja Woodson.  For 25 years, she and Eddie cherished their annual visits to John and Christine Haddock’s Santa Fe cottage home - enjoying its high desert enchantment and culture while reading, hiking, relaxing, and eating scrumptious New Mexican cuisine.  
Stephanie was independent, gracious, beautiful, graceful and deeply caring - described by many friends as the most empathetic person they’ve ever known. She cherished her family and was a role model to all she touched.  Stephanie was the love of Eddie’s life, his best friend, his soul mate, and his earth angel. Pi Phi friend, Janie Redding Emery, remembers her as an angel in disguise.
Stephanie is survived by her husband Eddie; three sons and their wives Eric and Yutong, Carey and Sarah, and Joel and Heidi; grandchildren Austin, Ethan, Finn, Lu Yao and Jiaze; niece Alison and her sons Sammy and Charlie; nephew Mike and his wife Anne; cousins Mary Virginia, Pam and husband Gene and their daughters Emmie and Elena.

231,232,Susan B. Gram,"01-06-1938 to 02-01-2020

Susan was born in Detroit to the late Leona Schmitz Baird and Byron B. Baird.  She grew up in Ypsilanti, MI and graduated Michigan State University in 1959.  Never a fan of cold weather, she and several friends accepted teaching contracts in San Diego, CA and immediately after graduation headed west to warmer climes.  Not long after, she met and married Emil, a young naval aviator from Dallas who was stationed at NAS North Island.  That started a 60 year marriage that included three children, a 30 year navy career, and seventeen world-wide family relocations.  Susan was quite adventurous and was always involved in some new challenging endeavor. 

A sampling of her many exploits:
-  Active participation and leadership roles with navy officer's wives clubs
-  When the children were barely school-age and while Emil was deployed to the Mediterranean in the USS Roosevelt, she packed up the family and moved to Italy to follow the ship's port visits - for NINE months…  
-   At middle age, she decided to experience the exhaustive job vetting processes with both the US State Department and the CIA (just to prove she could do it) but refused the commission offers  
-  Pursued graduate-level degree in her ""spare time"" to round out job qualifications for which she never accepted a position
- When the navy made Emil a Naval Attaché to Pakistan, Susan was a willing partner to take on the rigorous and demanding social duties required of the diplomatic posting  
- Enjoyed numerous fun-filled reunions with college sorority sisters and their spouses.

Emil always said that Susan had her life phases: There was the arts phase when she was deeply interested in sculpting and ceramics, the author phase when writing short stories consumed her time - but she was published only once in a local newspaper. Then there was the travel phase when she made some combination of road, rail or air excursion to various domestic or foreign destinations - sometimes with the children and sometimes alone but always when Emil was deployed.

Susan was an avid novel reader and crossword puzzle solver. Her mind was always working with challenges of some sort.  And throughout the children's formative years she was always active with their activities whether it was Little League baseball, gymnastics, fishing, flying model airplanes or school activities.  If the kitchen disposal crapped out, she fixed it.  If the often-stretched home finances needed fine tuning, she was right on top of it to make sure the bills were paid. She was the glue that kept the family together and functioning because dad was gone a lot. Throughout the good and bad times, she made sure the cards and letters flowed and dad was happily welcomed home from his job travels.  In her very senior years and final life phase, physical mobility became a serious challenge for Susan, causing her to become mostly home bound.  She never complained about her final ordeal and gracefully accepted that her body was no longer willing to accommodate her desired adventurous spirit.  Her family is grateful that she did not spend one single day in a nursing facility.  She passed away quietly in her sleep, pain free, with her loving family nearby. Susan is survived by husband Emil, three children Michael (Laura), Jane (Greg), and Robert, five step grandchildren and five step great grandchildren.  

A memorial service will be announced at a later date.

238,239,Dallas Jerry Kreps,"Dallas Jerry Kreps was born on March 12th, 1944, in Willmar, Minnesota, to the most wonderful, God-fearing parents in the world. He was later joined by four siblings, Rodney, Sherry, Larry, and Charles.

Raised on a Minnesota farm, he always said it was the best place for anyone to grow up. In 1962, he joined the US Navy and served four years. They took the train from Willmar to the induction center in Minneapolis, he remembered his mom cried the entire trip.  He enjoyed the service, being independent, making buddies and seeing the world.

He earned a business degree from Mankato State University in 1971. Only one problem, the country was in recession and there was no business.  So, hiring on with his uncle at highway contractor Duininck Bros. began his career working on the road.

He married the love of his life, Lois Ann Strom, on October 23, 1971. She was the best and most important thing in his life.  They shared a love for God and a love for helping others.  They have three children, Kelly, Danny, and Randy. Without sounding prejudice, he would say they are all very good kids, although his hair was not grey before they came along. He adored his five grandchildren, Lindsey, Tyler, Kobe, Zoe and Zuri, and had a special bond with each of them.

Summers are short up north (it is said that Minnesota has 2 seasons, winter and road construction), so the family moved to Texas in 1986. His mom said if she knew he would end up moving 1,000 miles away to Dallas, she would have named him something else! Road construction was a tough job, just right for his hard-working nature. He loved his work, the company, and the friendships, and retired in 2012 after 44 years with Duininck’s.  He truly lived out his favorite verse, Colossians 3:23, not just in his career but in all the work he did. “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters”. 

Dallas loved taking on one too many projects, camping and fishing in the mountains with the boys, scenic road trips in the camper with Lois, and playing games with family and friends (he will be a legend in Farkle circles for years to come.) He was a faithful, selfless, kind, and generous soul who truly loved people.

The past few years were difficult. Fighting pulmonary fibrosis, he could no longer enjoy many of the things he loved. However, he always praised the Lord. His life motto was “Do not criticize, condemn, or complain.” And through all the pain, he really did not complain. He wrote these words in preparation, “I thank God for every day I’ve had, and look forward to heaven.” Dallas went to be with his Savior on Sunday morning, January 19, 2020. He passed at his home in Justin, TX, his wife and family by his side.

Survived by wife Lois Ann Kreps, sister Sherry Miller, brothers Rodney Kreps and Larry Kreps, children Kelly Erickson, Danny Kreps, and Randy Kreps, and grandchildren Lindsey Moore, Tyler Moore, Kobe Kreps, Zoe Kreps and Zuri Kreps.

She was a devoted mother, always putting her children first. Her top priority was raising her children and her devotion to God. She was a great friend to all and would make time for everyone in her life. She was blessed to also have many great friends that will miss her too. She had beautiful green eyes and such a kind heart. It’s hard to put into words the great loss we all feel and to say she will be missed is an understatement.

Francis is also survived by his older Sister, Cleada Mae Smith, and her children and grandchildren as well as by his brother, Johnny Reed, his wife Martha and their children and grandchildren.  He also leaves behind many cousins, in-laws and relatives in Oklahoma, Texas and elsewhere.

Francis was born on the Reed Ranch in the panhandle of Texas.  He had platinum blond hair, deep blue eyes, rosy cheeks and a precious shy impish smile that stayed with him his whole life.  As a small child he enjoyed exploring the ranch,  riding ponies, and would often go off alone wandering and working on the ranch.  As a result of the Depression, Francis developed a strong work ethic and wasted nothing.   

In 1952, Francis began working for Walter Sowders at Sowders Dental Lab in Elk City, Oklahoma.  Both Walter and his wife Irma Sowders remained a great influence throughout his life.  In 1954, Francis graduated from Elk City High School and moved to Dallas where he went to work for United Dental Lab, Prosthetics Dental Lab and Codesco-Duffin Dental Lab.  Eventually, he opened Reed & Associates Dental Laboratory, which provided services to over 500 Dentists in Texas.  He was certified in all areas of Dental Technology and doing lab work was a passion and love.  Francis was inducted into the Dental Lab Hall of Fame for 50 years of service as a CDT (Certified Dental Technician).  In addition to his own work, Francis designed laboratory workplaces for many Dental Schools, and even set up a Dental Lab in the Texas Department of Corrections to teach prisoners a skill they could use after their release.  

After moving to Dallas, Francis found a passion for drag racing.  He was a Charter Member of National Hot Rod Association (NHRA), North Texas Timing Association (NTTA) and Rod Benders Car Club.  He ran a ‘56 Black Bel Air Chevy Coupe, a maroon colored ‘32 Ford (Deuce) Coupe Gasser and a hand built A/FD (A fuel dragster and burned 90% Nitro Methane in his 392 Chrysler Hemi that was a carbureted blown engine).  Francis set a world record (at that time) by breaking 180 mph in his A/FD in Houston, Texas after which Ed Iskedarian awarded him a sponsorship and world record jacket.  He had 22 title wins and many trophies in his A Stock 1956 Chevy Bel Air Coupe.  He also had a ‘40 Ford Coupe that he ran in a Stock car class.  He was the A/FD Top Eliminator at the Fuel Gas Championship in Oklahoma City and won the 1958 National Fuel Gas Championship in his A/FD Isky-Wiend Special beating “Big Daddy” Don Garlits.  Upon being drafted in the Army he convinced Iskedarian Cams and Wiend Manifolds to sponsor Bobby Langley’s Scorpion as a A/FD who was his great friend of more than 50 years.
He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1958 and trained at Camp Chaffee, Ft. Smith Arkansas working in the motor pool and dental lab.  At Fort Wolters in Mineral Wells, Texas, he flew both fixed wing and helicopters.  After leaving the Army, he continued flying and passed that love on to his sons.  He was a pilot who was qualified and certified as a pilot to fly many different aircraft. 

In December 1963, his mother Melva introduced him to the love of his life Jean Ann English who was a school teacher in Duncan, Oklahoma.  He married Jean Ann and they had two boys.  Through their 55 years of marriage, they endured hardship and enjoyed triumph as a couple and whose love nurtured their boys.  They have helped many friends and relatives over the years as a couple.  Francis loved taking his youngest son James with the Dallas Blackhawks Hockey Travel Team where James and the team won many trophies and tournaments.  He enjoyed watching Eric play baseball and was incredibly proud of Eric earning his Eagle Scout as Francis was, himself, a Life Scout.  In later years he enjoyed watching his grandson Jack play basketball and football and his granddaughter Helen swim.   

Francis was not boastful of his talents and was often a fun prankster with his hunting buddies and friends.  He loved to tell stories and jokes about life and his experiences with friends and family as well.  He loved his English Pointer Bird Dogs and enjoyed a passion for quail hunting particularly on the Coleman Ranch in Archer County, Texas.  Francis did things his way and on his terms in life.  The Reed family is very grateful to have had Francis in their lives and appreciate all of his compassionate and wonderful friends who were true to he and the family over the years, especially Max and Darrell Ann Jones and their children David, Nicky and Julie.

If you were a friend of his, he was loyal for life and would drop everything to help you out. He also loved having people over, so that he could grill for them.  He greatly enjoyed working at HomePro in Carrollton, Texas as their Quality Control Manager.    

Tom  is survived by his wife Janice Farmer and their fur babies Cracker and Hank; his brother Carl Farmer Jr. and his wife Dana Farmer; his sister Melanie Osborn; his nephews Christopher Osborn and his fiancé Devin Smith and David Farmer and his fiancé Victoria Lin; his nieces Ashley Barbosa and her husband Nathan Barbosa and Caitlin Osborn; his uncle Charles Walter Beamer III; his cousins Katherine M. Beamer,  C. Walter Beamer IV and his wife Jennifer Beamer and their children and Nicole Kirby and her husband Terry Kirby and their children; his mother-in-law LaNell Fogus; his sister-in-law Tracy Fogus; his wife's large extended family; and his devoted friends. 

Welcoming Tom into Heaven were his parents Carl and Linda Farmer; his grandparents John and Margaret Farmer, Charles Walter Beamer II and Mildred Beamer-Kidd and David Kidd; his father-in-law Tommy Fogus; and several close friends. After their joyous reunion, everyone stepped aside and one of them called out ""Release the Hounds!"" Charging to reunite with their best buddy Tom were Rocky, Taffy, Ralph, Nelson and Moose.
 
In lieu of flowers, the family would like memorial donations to BrightFocus Foundation for Alzheimer’s research.   https://support.brightfocus.org

Tom will be greatly missed by the many, many people whose lives he touched."
